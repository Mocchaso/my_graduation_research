I bought it for storage and storage. The color is also familiar to the room, I think that the cloth box of storage goods fitted perfectly and is easy to use. However, one of the two purchased was very hard to assemble. The instruction manual of the assembly also has a big difference in the one with a manual paper and one with a broken booklet, and the product of one paper is very difficult to enter with screws, 3 It took about twice as much time and effort. Why is there such a difference in the same product?
It is convenient that the height and width are just stored well. It's cheap but I do not feel cheap and I am familiar with not breaking the atmosphere of the room. Recording equipment etc is not necessary so it is enough.
Because shelves of other bookshelf made by other companies used for about 6 years are distorted, purchase here. Since there is no horizontal width of the shelf, I decided I thought it was difficult to apply an excessive load. It is also a point that shelves are not mobile. It houses children's books, books of books, new books, and so on. I can not fit the size of the book, but I could store it cleanly. The color is strange as it looks like a gray color of wood's natural color, but it is enough if you think from the price.
I use it by putting it sideways on the bed side and small articles on the top. It is a good feeling that materials and colors are familiar to the room. It's also lighter than wooden one.
It is not the same size as the stacking shelf but misunderstood and purchased. . Many things I was thinking to put in did not come in, and after I assembled it I had a bad feeling. Easy to assemble is good as a thing, but I posted not to make the same misunderstanding by someone. .
I use it as a TV stand lying down. The box also contains documents of A4 size.
