The finished product is fashionable, plentiful storage and easy to use. Just because it falls easily if you do not fix the top of the shelf, I think that it will be decided depending on where you put it, but it is recommended to purchase after investigating where it can fix the wall side on the shelf I will.
I made it to a bookshelf to be placed next to the study desk for my second daughter. I was planning to make it all together when I was the eldest daughter, but I seemed to be discontinued, so I bought it instead. Although assembly was still serious, I made solid screws on the operating shelf and liked it. It became a fashionable study room.
The design of the wooden frame and the wood grain can be seen slightly in white, it looks luxury for the price! It took 2 hours to assemble with two people who had not much furniture assembly experience, but if completed according to the instructions, it was completed properly!
I think assembling is simple and the structure is solid so I am making it sturdy. I use it as a bookcase for children.
I use it as a shoe shelf at the entrance. Short boots as it is, sneakers and pumps in storage goods. I can put as many numbers as it is.
I use it as a bookshelf in a child's room. Also displays books, accessories stored in boxes, Rika chan dolls and so on. It looks fashionable, shelf board is hard and thick, so it will not bend. It is likely to be used for a long time.
Purchased for a 3 year old girl's child's room. I was stuck with the material and color, so I am satisfied with the ideal. My daughter also delighted with a loud voice in a classic atmosphere. You can store plenty of picture books and toys. The accessory storage box fits in three sides beside it. I think that it can be used even if it grows big.
