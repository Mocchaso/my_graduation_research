It is easy to use except when it is caught for a while and it is difficult to tighten it.
As I am older I was weak, so assembly was a bit hard.
I bought it for storage under closet. Assembly was done by the same person, but it was made in the blink of an eye. The movement of the drawer is also light, with the rollers on the bottom, it is easy to move. Personally I like the place where inside can not be seen.
I bought it in the summer, but I tried purchasing the room clothes. However, because I thought about putting in winter, it was unexpectedly small and the quantity did not enter much. However, as summer has entered a lot, I would like to put in summer and make use of it. Since there are three stages, it enters a lot and it is convenient if you use a little thing if you use it with your family. Because the roller (caster?) Can also be removed, it was convenient to carry.
It's weak, but it's cheap and you can do it separately.
The price is reasonable. It might be gentle to the eyes with a gentle color like Annin Tofu rather than tight white. The product of this hand feels cheesy, but it is just barely. But it is convenient.
When moving, it is convenient to be gathered slightly smaller (compact) from the assembled state.
Easy to assemble and cheap, it is just right for putting on clothes. I think that it is impossible for heavy items.
