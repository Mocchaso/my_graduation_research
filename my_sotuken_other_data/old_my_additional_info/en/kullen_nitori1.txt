I purchased it to use it in combination with a sofa bed, but I decided to place it along the top wall of the layout. Although it may be moved occasionally, it is useful as a shed.
I used a mattress with feet so I thought it would be convenient if I had a table and bought it. It took 30 minutes to assemble, but it took me about 3 hours and it was quite painful. I think it is more than people. The finished product was smaller than the storage space thought, but it is handy.
