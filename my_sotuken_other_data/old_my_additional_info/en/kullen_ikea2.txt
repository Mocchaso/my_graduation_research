I bought it at the outlet, but it is cute as usual, and the function is also good! ! I am thinking I'm glad I bought it!
The size feeling which is not too big is just right, I put it as a slipper storage shelf for visitors at the front door. It looks fashionable and has a high-class feeling. We assembled with assembly service.
