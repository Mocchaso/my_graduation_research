First of all, I bought two pieces for small items such as accessory making materials and beads. It was easy to use, it was a nice feeling, so I purchased two additional items. Well I used it, I noticed that the corner was broken where I became. If you look closely well, the two similar parts (upper part of the case, both sides of the case) are broken or cracked. It was extremely simple packing (just putting the case in just-size cardboard), so it seems to have hit me during delivery. I also thought about using adhesive with adhesive, but since both of the two were damaged, we contacted them and exchanged them as expected. When exchanging, putting the corrugated card containing the case in a larger corrugated cardboard and inserting the cushioning material firmly was safe. I think that it would be better to stop over packaging, but I think that simple packaging is totally overwhelmed if the product gets scratched. I decided to write it here because I felt that I could prevent something like this just by wrapping it with cushioning material (bubble wrap etc.) and putting it in cardboard. I would be pleased if you could receive it as an opinion. The product of the essentials is also smooth and out of drawers and it comes with a casters so it is easy to clean up when cleaning, and likes the simple color form. If it is only a product, it is five â˜….
It was perfect for the storage place, so I bought it! However, it was taken by a child. Plarail, convenient for storing small toys. It fits perfectly under the study desk (the type that the drawer is not attached). It refreshes! When the Mugen Week begins, I will buy it for a store place!
