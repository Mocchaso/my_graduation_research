It was perfect for our gaps. I chose all the shelves of the same size, but good food and sundries are good. Since you can see the contents of the stocker a little, you may want to stop those who do not want to see the contents. I heard that casters can be used with other polypropylene products, and I felt that it is truly MUJI.
I bought it to store foodstuffs in the kitchen. Although I went around seeing a lot, I chose this with thorough simplicity and goodness of COSPA. I use a white Pradang on the inside of this side to blindfold. Although I am generally satisfied, there is a protrusion under the drawer for the handle, and it is a bit disappointing that if there is not this one centimeter a bit more things can be got .... I think that it is this position with ease of withdrawal, but things may get in the upper one ...
I store baby goods such as baby clothes! It's simple and it's nice to clear your closet! It's a bit disappointing that it's hard to open the lower side because the drawer's bottom is below.
We store a lot of CDs and DVDs in 4 stockers. I am adding it for this and it has 5 steps.
This was the PP item I bought for the first time. Easy to use. The difficulty is that it takes on a yellow tinge and deterioration is fast even in places where the sun is not hit.
I use it in the kitchen. It is good that the casters are attached from the beginning. Since the handle of the drawer is below, the drawer at the bottom is hard to open unless you bend. That is one star deduction.
