I also wrote other people, but it was serious with styrene foam scratches on it anyway. I have purchased furniture assembled by myself several times, but this is my first time. Assembly is not too difficult to do so, and colors are also good, so if there were no garbage problems it was four stars.
Since the goods arrived, the product was full of foamed polystyrene when opening the box to assemble it. First it took a while to remove the styrofoam that entered the product surface and the screw hole with static electricity. A lot of Styrofoam particles fall on the floor and I think that there is a problem that the goods arrive in such a state before assembling. Although the assembly of the goods themselves was able to be done without problems in particular, because there was a problem with packing, it is the number of this star because it took extra labor before and after assembling.
The size was just right. Since I was measuring the dimensions, I got under the desk safely. It took an extra time to assemble it. It is structurally solid accordingly. There was a new connection screw but it closed tightly. Just being regrettable is that the best boxes carry carry. I wanted him to be able to keep up with rails alone.
I did assembly by myself, but it took quite a while and it was serious. Next time I would like to ask for fee assembly.
