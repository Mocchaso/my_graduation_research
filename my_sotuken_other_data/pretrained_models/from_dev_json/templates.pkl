aVhello
p1028
aVhi there! i am very interested in your car! but, it is a little pricey. would you accept {price}?
p1029
aVit's a {title} model in excellent condition and very well maintained with everything working. i'd be willing to go down to {price}.
p1030
aVyes, but it's dirty, there isn't xm in the radio, and its only a 5 speed. the gas mileage is also very low on this vehicle, so how about {price}?
p1031
aVi'd be willing to go down to {price} because i like you, but i can't go any lower.
p1032
ag951
aVhello are you intrested in the phone?
p1033
aVyes, what
p1034
aVits a t {title}
p1035
aVwhat is wrong with the phone?

p1037
aVwell, i happened to have bought a used {title} s6 last week for {price}
p1038
aVwell, i plan to resell this phone for {price}, so i can't offer more than {price}.

aVhi i am really interested in the apartment. is it close to town?
p1042
aVhello, yes the apartment is about a 10 minute drive to the town
p1043
aVis it fully furnished?
p1044
aVthe downstairs area is, the upstairs however is not
p1045
aVand what about the smoking requirement? is it a smoking area or not?
p1046
aVyes, smoking is allowed
p1047
aVokay. so what's the price for it? the amount i see is way too high for me. can we work on that?
p1048
aVthe price is negotiable assuming you pass on a credit check. what is the current standing of your credit?
p1049
aVits in an excellent standing, and before we get down to the price. what is the deposit?
p1050
aVthe deposit is one months rent. so the price we agree on will be the deposit
p1051
aVsounds good. so the amount that i can propose is {price}
p1052
aVthat's a nice starting point. however, i have many interested buyers. i will counter at {price}

aVthis house looks perfect! is there a basement?
p1055
aVunfortunately there is not a basement.
p1056
aVwell is there anyway you could allow me to bring my cat along? i know you said no pets but i don't want to get rid of him
p1057
aVonce again. i am sorry, but i can't allow pets at this location. even the best pets do have occasional `` accidents'' and with this carpet can be very difficult to clean. i certainly hope this isn't a deal breaker to you, but i understand if it is.
p1058
aVwhat would you say to {price} with a deposit of {price}, additionally, how is your credit?
p1059
aVi have decent credit but i just broke up with my boyfriend and all i can afford right now is to pay a little over {partner_price} i really need a place to live.
p1060
aVi understand, if you don't mind me asking, what is your current source of income?
p1061
aVi am a school teacher.
p1062
aVthank you for letting me know. i appreciate the work you do. you have been very pleasent during this process. i'm willing to go down to {my_price} in this situation. assuming that you pass the credit check, which i'm sure that you will, we can get the lease agreement sorted out in about a week or so.

aVso, what's wrong with this phone?
p1066
aVit starts but won't go past the boost screen. i am no phone expert though.
p1067
aVwell, i think we can make a deal, i would like to buy the phone on the chance i can get it to work again.
p1068
aVgreat. how much would you like to offer.
p1069
aVwell, are there any other problems with the phone besides the boot screen problem you mentioned?
p1070
aVwell, for a 6 year old used phone that may or may not work, that has been replaced by a new phone that costs only {price}, i'm willing to take a chance and offer {price}.
p1071
aVwould you be willing to do {price}?
p1072
aVno, i have to stay firm at {partner_price}, there's a good chance that the phone is in a permanent bootloop state that i can't do anything to recover, and then i'd have to just recycle it.
p1073
aVcan we meet in the middle at {price}?
p1074
aVi'll do {price}, that's my best offer.
p1075
aVok sounds good.
p1076
ag960
ag951
aVhi how's it going
p1077
aVhello. i'm well. i hope you are too. i'd love to get this car but i can't afford the listed price. what deal can you make for cash?
p1078
aVwhat is your offer?
p1079
aVi can take if off your hands for {price} cash in hand. the car is nearing 100000 miles and i think it's a fair price for cash.
p1080
aVits still got about 16k miles until 100k. how about we meet in the middle?
p1081
aVwhat would be your counter offer? it's no hot rod.
p1082
aV{price} cash?
p1083
aVi don't have that much cash. that's pretty far from the middle. what about {price}?
p1084
aV{price} is as low as i can go.
p1085
aV{price} is as low as i can go.

ag951
aVhi. do you have a picture of this item? i'm very interested.
p1087
aVno dio not have a picture of it. but i can tell you in very good condition
p1088
aVokay. how wide is the shelf?
p1089
aVit is wide enough to hold books and other items
p1090
aVdo you have exact measurements?
p1091
aVno i do not have exact measurements but it is a reproduction of the french original
p1092
aVokay. how much are you looking to sell it for?
p1093
aVlist price is {listing_price} but am willing to negoitate
p1094
ag951
aVhello! what do you think of the apartment?
p1095
aVhi, i'm interested in it. do you think we could maybe do {price} for the place.
p1096
aVthe apartment is newly renovatedand in such a {title} neighborhood. how do you feel about {price}?
p1097
aV{my_price} still seems too much for the place given the fact that i have to use coins to use the laundry. can we met half way at {price}?
p1098
aV{price} and you have yourself a deal.
p1099
aS'{price}'
p1100

aVhello
p1104
aVhi i am interesed in the chair your have sale but i want to know some details. i am 6ft 5in and weigh 250lbs. will this hold me?
p1105
aVwell, good thing you asked because this chair is just the right {title} for you if you are over 6ft.
p1106
aVsweet! would you be willing to take {price} for the chair?
p1107
aVtruth be told. my initial sale price for this is much, much higher. it's {price}. we need to talk this out.
p1108
aVwell they list at office max for {listing_price} and this one is used. so the highest i would go is about {price}
p1109
aVmore accurately, though, this is refurbished. i only `` unboxed'' the package, and intermittently used it. meaning the quality of it is still considerably higher than a used chair. {my_price} is severely underselling it. i want {price} because the condition is too close to new.
p1110
aVim sorry i can not go that high {price} is im highest offer take it or leave it
p1111
aVi have a counteroffer. {price} is the absolute lowest i can go on my part. if you buy a used chair anywhere else, it will not be as great of a condition as this.
p1112
ag960
ag951
aVhello
p1113
aVhi, how much would you like to spend for this item?
p1114
aVi am looking to spend no more than {price}
p1115
aVokay, are you willing to go a bit higher for a quality place?
p1116
aVmaybe, if pets were allowed.
p1117
aVunfortunately no pets allowed
p1118
aVthen my price is not adjustable unfortunately.
p1119
aVokay, the lowest i can go is {price}
p1120
aVnot {partner_price}?
p1121
aVno, only {partner_price}
p1122
ag960
ag951
aVhow new are the {title} and bathroom?
p1123
aVboth have been redone in the past year.
p1124
aVdoes the bathroom have a shower and a bath?
p1125
aVyes.
p1126
aVand could you tell me what color it is?
p1127
aVthe bathroom is pained white, and the combo shower bath is also white.
p1128
aVsweet. is there anyway you'd allow me to bring my dog? i swear she never pees in the house.
p1129
aVsorry, i can't make any exceptions to the no pets rule.
p1130
aVare you willing to pay {price} if i throw in a {price} coupon package for local businesses?
p1131
aVis that for any of the local businesses or just one in particular?
p1132

p1140
aVhas it ever been in an accident?
p1141
aVno accidents and it has all the papers with it.
p1142
aVif you could come down a little to say {price}, i would take it happily.
p1143
aVi think you will like this car an i want to sell it to you, so how about i meet you half way and we settle for {listing_price}
p1144
aVthe listing price is {listing_price}.
p1145
aVi feel that it is worth more than {listing_price} the listing price is the lowest i can go.
p1146
aVwell you should have placed the add differently. i don't feel you open to offers then.
p1147
aVwell you should have placed the add differently. i don't feel you open to offers then.
p1148
ag960
ag951
aVthis great {title} is going for {listing_price}!
p1149
aVthere are no washer dryer. i would consider it if you can make an offer of {price}
p1150
aVthat depends on how your credit is?

aVmy credit would be excellent with no doubt.
p1152
aVand you would be able to pay that with no problem if i gave you that deal?

p1162
aVjust changed.
p1163
aVi'd like to offer you {price} for this
p1164
aVthat is a little low but wan to take care of this quickly, how about {price}?
p1165
aVi think i can work with that. deal!
p1166
ag960
ag951
aVget this car for the low price of {listing_price}.
p1167
aVi really liked the car but the price is way too high for me
p1168
aVwell i did some research and this is what most cars like this had been selling for. i thought it was a fair price.
p1169
aVi don't think its a fair price. i would appreciate it if you could reconsider the price. is the car used?
p1170
aVit is used. but it only has 15000 miles on the engine.
p1171
aVi am interested in it, but it only fits my budget if i can pay {price}?
p1172
aVwould you not be able to do at least {price}?
p1173
aVokay, i could do {my_price} but i need more details about the car though please!
p1174
aVwell it is in excellent condition. it was 3 rows of seats, and if you don't need them they can fold down for storage.
p1175
aVgreat thanks. so do you accept cash or credit?
p1176
aVi prefer cash if you have it.
p1177
aVi prefer cash if you have it.

aVhow about the price?
p1184
aV{listing_price} is the price
p1185
aVare you gonna come down alittle?
p1186
aVi can do {price}
p1187
aVnothing less than that?
p1188
aVno that's the last i could do because i assure you that you won't regret this purchase!
p1189
aVand will you be delivering it?
p1190
aVi don't do delivery but in your case i could do that for you!

aVhello i am interested in buying.
p1193
aVgreat! i am listing this at {listing_price}
p1194
aVi understand. however, this apartment has a lot of amenities that you may like. it's clean, large, and close to the {title}. in fact, you can see the {title} from the apartment
p1195
aVthat sounds great. that countertop looks very outdated. i am stuck at {price} but if the countertop was updated i could probably go much higher ...
p1196
aVwell, we are not finished updating just yet.we still have to do the kitchen. it's available on july 1st so we still have some time to replace it. what's the highest you think you could go?
p1197
aVi think {price} would be fair with a new countertop.
p1198
aVi really couldn't let it go for less than the {listing_price} asking price. i am remodeling more than just the counter. new carpet, new appliances, freshly painted and i put in an energy efficient hvac so your utility bills will be lower.

ag960
aVhow would you feel if i waived the first month's rent, but you have to agree to a {price} month lease?
p1201
aVi can't go any higher than {partner_price} and i didn't think you were coming back so i submitted it as my final offer.
p1202
aVi think with this location and the remodel's i'm putting in to it, i can't go 500 lower, so i'll have to reject your offer. thank you for your interest, though.
p1203
aVthanks for considering it. have a good night.
p1204
ag951
aVhello

p1210
aVyou won't find anything below {price} in {title} creek.

aVwell, we may have a little wiggle room, so please make an offer. maybe we can find a price that works for the both of us.
p1224
aVwell as per your ad, the listing item is for {listing_price}. i wonder why you're asking {my_price}?
p1225
aVwell, we have others that are interested in the vehicle as well. so due to popular inquiry, we had to raise the price. i am waiting to hear back from two clients. but if you can agree to purchase the vehicle i will sell it to you!
p1226
aVas per your listing price, i am willing to pay {price}?
p1227

p1249
aVi am willing to negotiate.
p1250
aVi found a different one that i think i could probably make do with for {price}, but if i could get what i really want for not much more than that, it would totally be worth it.
p1251
aVwell it is in the original box and has a 1 year factory warranty. what about {price}?
p1252
aVi was hoping closer to {price}?
p1253

aVthat is great; i'm glad to hear it. what would you think of an offer of {price} for the item?
p1271
aVi'm very sorry, but that is simply too low for such a fantastic and original item. this is an exact reproduction of the french original, and you will not buy anywhere else in america.
p1272
aVunderstandable. what are you expecting for the item?
p1273
aVwell the full price of the item is {listing_price} dollars, and this is including our fantastic shipping option, covered by a non-damage warranty. i am willing to lower my price a bit but i can't go too low. would {price} dollars be acceptable to you?

ag951
aVhey, so i have this {title} for sale. it's treated me great, it's only {listing_price}.
p1306
aVhi. i am interested in your {title}. would you be willing to accept and offer of {price}?
p1307
aVi can't do that, how about {price} and i'll drop it off.
p1308
aVi think that might work for me. can you tell me anything else about the table, any defects?
p1309
aVthe table is scratched all on top, it wobbles, and one of the {title} snapped on me and i had to glue it back on.
p1310
aVthat being the case i don't think i'm interested after all. i'm looking for something that will actually be in pretty good condition and that will be durable. i'm afraid your {title} just isn't a good deal for me.
p1311
aVlook i'll go down to {price} it's really not all that bad.
p1312
aVno, sorry. the snapped leg being glued back on really decided things for me and i'm going to have to decline that offer. too bad.
p1313
aVfinal offer, i'll take the time to nail the leg back into the table.
p1314
aVi'm sorry a final offer of what, the {my_price}?
p1315
aVyeah

ag951
aVhello are you there?
p1319
aVyes, i am here to discuss with you the room?
p1320
aVi see where you are coming from, but given the location of the {title} i find this to be a competitive price so going that low is just not possible at the moment. is there any question you have about the {title}?
p1321
aVwell i see it's near {title}, but i was wondering exactly how close it is to say restaurants around the area and how convenient it would be to travel around?
p1322
aVbeing one mile from west berkley bowl, it should be easy to find food. even if you don't have transporation, there is major bus lines just a few blocks away and should be quite accessable.
p1323
aVah okay i see, well in the case i can understand the price but i am still on a tight budget. i am really looking to spend no more than {price} for the room.
p1324
aVwell i am really trying to stay within {price} dollars and not go much further than that, the room is highly sought after.
p1325
aVi understand, can we settle for somewhere in-between maybe {price}?
p1326
aVi'm afraid the lowest i can possible go is {price} woudl thsi work for you?
p1327

aVi've seen similar trucks for sale go for around {price}.
p1331
aVthe other {title} i was looking at is {price} and it has the same amount of miles and in the same condition. but it's a different color. i'd be willing to give you {price} for this and i have cash in hand.
p1332
aVthat's a nice offer, but a little less than i'm willing to sell at. i have several interested buyers i am in negotiations with. i'm willing to go to {price}
p1333
aV{price} is the highest i can go. that's my final offer.
p1334

ag960
ag951
aVhello! i saw your ad and was wanting to see if you would be willing to take {price} for it.
p1336
aVfor this nice {title} that is much to low. right now i'm selling it for {listing_price}.
p1337
aVi wouldn't be able to verify that i'd be paying a fair price considering the company no longer makes it. what would be the least you'd take?
p1338
aVsince this comes with the mattress as well i would think about going down to about {price}
p1339
aVwhat if you sell just the {title}?
p1340
aVat this time i am selling them as a package deal.
p1341
aVokay, i can offer {price}.
p1342
aVwhat if i throw in a blanket, sheets, and a pillow all this for {price}?
p1343

aVyes but is it a wooden one, a metal one? colored wood?
p1351

aVwell, let me tell you, campy means campagnolo, but as you're interested in this fine bicycle i'm sure you're already familiar with that.
p1429
aVah, yes i am a fine connasuer of bikes! i notice that the wheel size for this {title} is difficult to come by these days and also that brakes tend to wear over time, even when not in use. so i am prepared to offer you {price} for the bicycle. how does that sound?
p1430
aVoh, friend, this is a fine machine, i couldn't take only {my_price} for it. it's a steal at {listing_price}!
p1431
aVsince it's in {title} condition, how about {price}? it will take me quite a while to find fresh treads for these wheels!
p1432
aVwell, we're getting closer, but i'm afraid {my_price} is still too low. would you be willing to come pick the {title} up?
p1433

p1445
aVwhat's the lowest you and your friend could pay monthly? maybe we can make something work.

p1464
aVi'm sorry, that's far too low. since you know {title}'s reputation for quality, you know it's worth more than that.

aVwell, i have chronic migraines and one of my triggers is any smell, so i'm afraid my interest has just plummeted:(
p1472
aVdid i say drakkar noir? i meant homeopathic alpine water that's been chanted over by monks for at least eight years. {price}?
p1473
aVi'm sorry, i find homeopathy and any other pseudoscience to be profoundly upsetting as well. i'd be willing to go as high as {price}.

p1478
aVwell, if i need to replace the hv in 10,000 miles, that's roughly around {price}, plus tax and inspection. i'd still be willing to buy the car, but i don't think i could do better than {price}, in light of the work it will soon need.

p1591
aVhi there
p1592
aVwhat do you like about the {title}? i like the wood finish.
p1593
aVi know you havn't had the pleasure yet.... but its like sleeping on a cloud! seriously. lol only reason im selling this item is the mrs just accepted a position in japan so we are shedding all our furniture unfortunately ...... it was tempting to stay state side just to keep sleeping on the cloud plus our other items.:)
p1594
aVthe furniture is imported italian and headboard, footboard, set of rails, 3 slats, and the memory foam mattress all together was just over {price} ...... original ad i was asking {price} for the set this {listing_price} is already a reduced price.:'(
p1595
aVi see, it look perfect. i'm willing to buy it today if it comes with free shipping?
p1596
aVwere you in need of a dresser or an antique chair? again we are moving and need everything gone ....... make it an even {price} i can toss in the 4 drawer dresser shown in photo, the 3 pictures shown, and the {title} antique looking arm chair? with your free shipping sweety:)

aVhello!
p1599
aVi certainly can! the unit is located in a great spot with {title} views, close to bart. it has been fully remodeled with new carpeting. it is {title} bedrooms and they are very spacious. 800+ square feet in total
p1600
aVthe area is the {title} foothills and the schools are rated the best in the {title} area. the neighborhood is very safe!
p1601
aVawesome! i do however have a very large dog would that be a problem?
p1602
aVpets are not preferred but with an extra pet deposit i think we can come to an agreement.
p1603
aVunfortunately, that is too low. the asking price is {listing_price} which includes utilities. add on the pet deposit, which is {price}, and you are looking at {price}
p1604
aVthe highest i could possibly go is {price}+ deposit would that be ok with you?
p1605
aVthe only way that works is if you take utilities in your name. the total would then be {price} with the pet deposit included.
p1606
aVi can do that:)
p1607
aVi can do that:)
p1608

p1610
aVi am willing to drop it off for free, and also throw in a warranty for a year. would you consider taking {listing_price}?
p1611
aVno, that is just out of my price range
p1612
aVlowest i can go is {price}
p1613
aVi don't know ... i've seen similar items go for around {price} from other sellers in the past few months
p1614
aVbut this one is {title} and comes with a warranty. {price}.
p1615
aVi understand ... how much would you drop from that price if i pick up the item myself. you said you would drop it off, but you didn't realize that i am about 800 miles away
p1616
aVi will accept your offer of {my_price}, agree?
p1617
aVsure, i can do that
p1618
ag960

aVutilities are separate
p1624

aVand the breaks?
p1653
aValso just replaced this march.
p1654
aV{title}'s with 90k miles in great condition usually sell for around {price}, so that's my offer
p1655
aValright, well that's quite a bit lower than what i'd hoped for. is there any chance you would settle on {price}?
p1656
aVi'll split the difference with you and pay {price} since you have newer breaks and tires
p1657

p1854
aVwould i be able to move in right away?
p1855
aVabsolutely, previous tenants already moved out.
p1856
aVawesome. i'd love to offer {price} today!
p1857
aVnot going to be able to take that, this place is in such a high demand that the owner is wanting at least {price} for the place. i could try talking to him and see if he'll lower it?
p1858
aVyes please. i'd be able to go a little higher but not {my_price}
p1859
aVbetween {price} and {price}
p1860
aVjust got off the phone with the owner, lowest he said he'd do {price}. i know it may be a bit much but just remember the location, walking distance from downtown, nightlife, and public transport. the city is basically your oyster with this place
p1861
aVokay i'll figure it out. i don't want to let this go so i'll take it!
p1862
ag960
ag951

p1866
aVyou have to be willing to pick it up today, and pay cash
p1867
aVare you moving out?

aVhello, i am interested in the apartment you have for rent
p1881
aV{title}, what can i tell you about it
p1882
aVdo you have any flexibility on your pet policy?
p1883
aVi don't really mind all pets, if it is a cat or a small dog that is quiet i usually will let you have it there but there is an additional fee of {price} per month.
p1884
aVokay thank you. i do not have any pets but it's a good option to have in the future. the price is a little high for my budget at the moment. would you be willing to lower the price if i pay water utilities?
p1885
aVthe utilities are included so no need to do that. i could lower the price to {price} a month and just charge you one month security instead of a month and a half if that helps.
p1886
aVmy budget really allows for around {price} right now.
p1887
aVthat is really low for me to accept, the lowest i could go is {price} i could divide the security deposit over several months so you would not have to pay it all at one time before moving in.
p1888
aVokay i appreciate the flexibility. let's do that. where do we start?
p1889
aVokay i appreciate the flexibility. let's do that. where do we start?

p1892
aVsince it's an older model( generations old), can you go {price}? i just want a phone for my daughter to take on school trips and such.
p1893
aVcan you do at least {price} iphones are originally not cheap when they first come out but this will handle all your daughters needs.they are top line pieces of work.
p1894
aVi'll pay {price} and send a courier to collect it so that we don't have to deal with postage.
p1895
aV{price} and i will take it to you.
p1896

p1909
aVim sure a goldfish would be fine, as it won't damage thee property like a cat or dog.
p1910
aVlol, very true! what is the parking situation?
p1911
aVit doesn't clarify, but parking lot garage same as any other loft
p1912

p1950
aVsince it is in the {title} is there flexibility in the price? i would like to pay around {price}
p1951
aVthis is an up and coming {title}, not what you see on tv. i would be willing to go {price} month
p1952
aVi have children and i will need to pay extra to protect them( security system, etc). therefore i would like to pay {partner_price}. however i am willing to pay {price}
p1953
aVif you could go to {price}, we have a deal.

aVis your credit good? i'm sorry but i can only rent to people with good credit.
p1957
aVyes my credit is fabulous
p1958
aVgreaat! let's make a deal then. the apartment is available and within walking distance to parks, schools, bus stops. new carpet, haardwood floors, high ceilings. large front and back yard. do you have any questions?
p1959
aVyes. is it pet friendly?
p1960
aVyes, what kind of pet are you thinking of?
p1961
aVi have a 60 lb german shepherd
p1962
aVwow big dog! well, we will need to add a pet deposit of {price}. a one time fee
p1963
aVokay that is fine. are you flexible on the price? i have a large family and {listing_price} is not in my budget. we were looking for somewhere around {price}.
p1964
aVwell i am currently on welfare and my monthly checks are {price} so that is the highest i could go. this house would be perfect for my babies though. could you consider {price} for us?

aVi am very interested place you have for rent. is it in a good, quiet community?
p1967
aVthis is one of the best communities around. it is also very quiet. not too many people around.
p1968
aVi like everything about it. is there any room on the monthly price?
p1969
aVas long as you can pay the deposit, and sign the 3 month lease there is some room to go down on the price
p1970
aVhow about this. i would willing to sign a longer lease, say 6 months, if we could get the price down to say {price} month.
p1971
aV6 months for {my_price} a month works for me!

aVis this listing for an apartment or the house?
p1974
aVthis listing is for a {title}.
p1975
aVoh, i'm sorry, i didn't read that at first. is it close to town or shopping? like grocery stores or school?
p1976
aVyes, it is very close to a local strip mall, within walking distance. there is a whole foods and a chick fil a so this is a very hot location.
p1977
aVoh, i love whole foods! does it come with any amenities like washer dryer, dishwasher?
p1978
aVyes, it has a dishwasher and you will have your own personal washer dryer. samsung appliances, brand new last year.
p1979
aVthat sounds fantastic! i am very interested but i just can't comfortably afford {listing_price}. would you take {price}?.
p1980
aVi am willing to negotiate on the price a little. i could drop the price down significantly if you are willing to forgo the parking spot
p1981
aVthat's a pretty big loss ... is there street parking?
p1982
aVyes there is, however parking is a hot commodity so that space is worth a significant discount. i would still let you store a bicycle in the garage. you could fit a grocery bag in the basket of your bike.
p1983
aVi probably should walk more anyway ... alright, what would you be willing to let me rent it for without the parking spot?
p1984
aV{price} without the spot. that should be within your budget?
p1985
aV{price} without the spot. that should be within your budget?

p1988
aVlol ... yep. that's the actual car. it looks good doesn't it?
p1989
aVi suppose, is there anything wrong with it?
p1990
aVnothing is wrong with it. it's in perfect condition and everything including the a c works. i'm looking for {price} for it
p1991
aVi don't know, how many miles are on it?
p1992
aV80,000 which is really great considering how old the car is
p1993
aVwell, an 8 year old car with 80,000 miles on it? i'd like to pay {price}.
p1994
aVthat's unacceptable. this car is in great condition. i can go for {price}
p1995
aVif you're willing to come down to {price}, i'll come pick it up today.

aVi love the {title}! how long have you had it?
p1998
aVi bought it in march of last year, so a bit longer than one year.
p1999
aVi love the color of it, as well. i saw something like this in another store and it was around {listing_price} new ... is there a way we can get that price a little lower?
p2000
aVi am willing to negotiate, sure. what price did you have in mind?
p2001
aVgiven the year of usage and my personal budget, i would feel comfortable at {price}. i have friends with a truck. so, you won't have to lift a finger.
p2002
aV{my_price} is lower than i would feel comfortable letting it go for. it is not very old at all, and it really is in almost like new condition, seens a fairly little amount of use. i would be willing to meet you in the middle- how does {price} sound?
p2003
aVlittle to no use? that's a plus! could we meet at the `` new'' middle of {price}? i really need another {title} ...
p2004
aV{price} is the best i can do. that really is more than fair i believe.
p2005
aV{price} is the best i can do. that really is more than fair i believe.

ag960
ag951
aVnice bike you got there. but it's a bit pricey. how about i pay you {price} and i come and take it off your hand?
p2007
aVi'm willing to negotiate but this ia {title} bicycle. it's worth the money. i can not go as low as {my_price} if you're willing to pick up the bike, i can go down to {price}.
p2008
aVi can definitely come and pick it up. how about we do {price}? we have a deal then
p2009
aVi'll do {my_price} you have a deal
p2010
ag960

p2012
aVi got it in one of those storage auctions
p2013
aVcool. that was a good find. it looks well used. have you tested it to make sure it works?
p2014
aVyes, i plugged it in, it seems to be in full working order
p2015
aVgreat. i'm strapped for cash so would you accept {price} for it?
p2016
aVi don't know. if i'm honest i'm strapped for cash myself( my wife says i need to stop bidding on storage container auctions, but they're just so damn exciting). how about {price}?
p2017
aVthat sounds good. i'll take it.
p2018
aVthat sounds good. i'll take it.

ag960
ag951
aVgood evening!
p2020
aV{my_price} is quite a bit lower than i was wanting to sell this {title} for, it is a really great {title}. i can offer it for {price}, but i will make sure the {title} gets tuned before you pick it up.
p2021
aVthat's nice. i was wondering how much it would cost to get it tuned. do you think you can do {price}? i need to borrow a truck and get some help to load it.
p2022
aVif we can leave the deal at {partner_price}, you can borrow my truck and i will make sure to have four of my friends here to help you load it.
p2023
aVi think that's a deal. can i come look at it first though?
p2024
aVof course, i wouldn't expect you to buy it without seeing it first.
p2025
ag960
ag951
aVhello. are you interested in the {title}?
p2026
aVhello, i am interested in your {title}. would you be willing to take {price}?

ag951
aVhi so i have a great closet {title} for just under {price}. do you have any questions?
p2031
aVare you the original owner? is this the actual picture of your item? are there any dings, dents, chips in paint? thanks for initiating convo!
p2032
aVyes, i am the only owner. it was well taken care of. the item of the photo is indeed mine. there's no chips, dents or dings. you have to pick it up.
p2033
aVokay. is this heavy? will you be available to help load?
p2034
aVno, my backs bad, you have to lift it yourself. please have cash when you get here. my little niece can help you get it in your vehicle.
p2035
aVi can't go {listing_price}. can you do {price}, since i am meeting you and loading myself?
p2036
aVabsolutely not, this is a designer closet rack. the lowest i could go is {price}.
p2037
aV{title} sounds like ikea to me. i would hardly call it designer. {price}
p2038
aVmeet me in the middle at {price} and you have to disassemble it.
p2039
aVit needs to disassembled before i get there. if i have to disassemble, i must go back and insist on {price}
p2040
aVit's not worth my time to disassemble it for {price}. you can do it when you get here.
p2041
aVthen i need a deeper discount. disassembling is part of your job as the owner, especially if you want this gone.
p2042
aVyou just said you'd do {price}.
p2043
aVyou just said you'd do {price}.
p2044
ag960
aVi don't know, is there anything else you can do for me?

aVnone of the parts are missing. most haven't even been used.
p2050
aVoh, gotcha, i misread the statement. would you consider negotiating the price? i love the phone, but not the price, hahahaha
p2051
aVi would be able to part with it for {price}.
p2052
aVhow about {price} and i will pick up? i have cash in hand, ready to go into your hand
p2053
aVthat sounds fair. deal.

aVthat is correct yes, upstairs has a full {title} with shower, tub, toilet vanity ... downstairs just toilet and vanity
p2058
aVand is that a hard stance on no pets? just been shopping round and this place does look really nice ...
p2059
aVi can allow small pets, but would rather not have larger dogs as i've had bad experiences with damage
p2060
aVoh, that's totally fine. i appreciate you making a concession. does {price} sound good? we have no credit issues etc. so the transaction would be pretty easy.

aVhi, what type of finish is the pressedboard on the table?
p2087
aVwell, it's particle board with an ash veneer, like most light {title} desks.
p2088
aVthe height is 36'', and the feet are {title} by around 1 inch, for uneven surfaces. the {title} themselves don't telescope
p2089
aVoh i see. would you be willing to accept {price} if i pick it up tonight?
p2090
aVi think that's a little lean. if you are willing to pick it up, i'd be willing to sell it for {price}
p2091
aVthe best i can do is {price} i'm in a budget crunch but i'd really like to have this table.
p2092
aVwell, i'll tell you what, come up to {listing_price}, and i'll throw in the swivel chair in the photo too.
p2093
aVcan you do {my_price}?
p2094
aVa {title} and a chair for only {my_price}? well, i guess, if you're willing to pick it up tonight.

p2096
aVokay, great, i'll put on some clothes?

ag960
ag951
aVhello! how are you? are you interested in this {title} chair?
p2099

p2100
aVwhat would you like to know?
p2101
aVare they comfortable?
p2102

p2104
aVwould you be able to go to {price}?
p2105

p2106
ag960
ag960
ag951
aVhi!
p2107
aVhi. make an offer. if it's reasonable this car goes with you
p2108
aVwell i am not going to make an offer without some details!
p2109
aVthat's fair. what do you need to know?
p2110
aVhas the car gone through a documented inspection? does it come with an accident damages report?
p2111
aVnothing like that, but it has no problems whatsoever. if you want, i can go smog it for you and it will pass no problems. and those rims and tires are over {price} bucks. the mods on this car is off the hook.
p2112
aVok. sounds reasonable, but you need to make sure in the future that your cars goes through this process if you want to sell them. i will do {price} since this car lacks the requirements for sale.
p2113
aVum inspection is not an requirement in california. all we have to do is the smog. and there is no way i can sell this car for less than {price} it has soem sentimental values because it belonged to my son who's in the marines now. you know.
p2114
aVi understand but i can not risk buying a car that has internal damage. that is a liability to me and i will end up spending thousands in repairs. i will do {price}
p2115
aVthe airbag light is probably the recall issue. the dealer will fix it for free. or i can get it fixed. and if you can't do {price}, we really can't do a deal here.
p2116
aVif you are able to get the airbag fixed i will go up to {price}, you probably wont get better than that from anyone my friend.
p2117
aVyeah no deal then. good luck
p2118
aVpoor guy.
p2119
ag951
aVit's a bargain for this delightful {title} for your {title}. everyone needs one!
p2120
aVi do need one but i see that i would have to paint it so that's work for me. does it have any other defects?
p2121
aVno other defects other than needing a good rinse and coat of nice paint. if you want i'll do it for you. it will take a couple of days to fully dry and smell free, but that's doable.
p2122
aVthat would be good of you but only if you have the time and supplies. would you be willing to accept {price} for it. i'll even pick it up.
p2123
aVi do have the time and the supplies. but i can't do any lower than {price} for this. at {listing_price} i'm already giving it away, practically
p2124
aVi appreciate the effort you are willing to put into it but i'm poor. how about {price}?
p2125
aV{my_price}, but i don't do the refinishing job. that's on you. deal?
p2126
aVi guess that will work. {my_price} it is.
p2127
aVi guess that will work. {my_price} it is.
p2128
ag960
ag951
aVhello, i'm interested in your {title} you have for sale

aVhi i am interested in the house you just posted.
p2139
aVhello. sure thing please let me know if you have any questions?
p2140
aVi see its been remodeled. can you tell me what has been upgraded?
p2141
aVthe floor has been remodeled as well as the bathrooms
p2142
aVyes one bathroom. well, the location is very much convenient, and tell you what? i can give it to you for {price} with a {price}% off for your first rent.
p2143
aVthe location is convenient. is that a {price} car garage or does the other garage belong to another house?
p2144
aVno its {price} car garage
p2145
aVi can do {price}. can i install indoor outdoor security cameras from my current {title}?

ag960
ag951
aVhello. i really liked this {title} highlander. have been looking for it for a long time now, and this is something that caught my attention
p2149
aVyeah, it's a wonderful vehicle, very spacious and extremely reliable. as you can see it's recently gotten a brand new engine and that's why i'm asking {listing_price}.
p2150
aVah, i can't come that low buddy. the newer engine replacement cost me about that much. you've got a car here that has 183,000 miles on the body but the heart of the car only has 15,000 miles. if you look online you will find the same vehicle listed at {price} and above with 180,000 plus miles on the whole thing. i'm willing to come down to {price} but any lower and i will be losing money.
p2151
aVokay i can do that. as long as i am assured that this car has never had any major breakdown and that i will be happy with the purchase
p2152
ag960
ag951
aVhi i see you have a go pro for sale
p2153
aVyes, it is in great condition.
p2154
aVhow many times have you used it?
p2155
aVoh, i barely used it. i did use the curved adhesive mount so that is the only thing that i don't have. all in all i would say it was used about 3 hours.
p2156
aVoh i see. you only have the flat mount? are there
p2157
aVright, i just have the flat mount but the whole package is in great condition. the 3-way pivot arm is in perfect shape. there is barely any play in the motion but it is smooth and effortless so you get a nice panning action.
p2158
aVthat sounds really good. since i will have to purchase the additional mount, would you accept {price}?
p2159
aVlisten, i'll be honest, the list price is {listing_price} and this thing is in new condition minus the mount. it's true that i have used it though minimally, so i'd be willing to let it go at {price}.
p2160
aVi could do that ... agreed at {price}?
p2161
aVi could do that ... agreed at {price}?

p2165
aVok. well i see you're in the market for a {title}. i have one in great condition that i'm willing to part with for {listing_price}
p2166
aVi bet it's a little old and needs tuning, how about i offer you {price} dollars
p2167
aVwell it is a few years old and it does need tuning but it has been kept up very well. i think {price} would be better.
p2168
aVok let's do it for {my_price} but you have to promise me that you will deliver the {title} to my home, fair enough?
p2169

p2173
aVok, cool. you want to come take a look at it?
p2174
aVok sure but only have {price} dollars in this moment
p2175
aVsorry, i can't go that low. it is a {title} bike after all and in great condition. i can do {price} though.

aVare there any problems with the car?
p2181
aVa airbag light stays on but the car runs great.
p2182
aVokay, well, i'm interested. i'd like to pay {price}
p2183
aVthat is kind of low, i just poured 2k into this car to get new tires.
p2184
aVwell, it's still a 9 year old car.
p2185
aVi will offer you {price} and i will throw in a warranty for you so if anything goes wrong it will be covered.
p2186
aVif you can come down to {price} i'll come pick the car up.
p2187
aVwill you go to {price} and ill throw in free tinted windows?
p2188
aVthat sounds reasonable.

ag951
aVhello! i understand you are interested in the property i'm selling?
p2190
aVyes, i am interested. how long has this house been on the market.
p2191
aVthe apartment has been on the market for about 2 weeks.
p2192
aVi like the details on the house and it seems nice. how is the neighborhood? how are the apartment neighbors?
p2193
aVgreat neighborhood! very close to shops, franklin park, and public transport.
p2194
aVsounds great the price seems pretty steep, if you do not mind may you please accept my offer of {price}.
p2195
aVsounds great the price seems pretty steep, if you do not mind may you please accept my offer of {price}.
p2196
ag960
aVthis is an apartment inside of an old {title}, so it is not in a complex with a gym or pool. the perks are the {title} architecture, and the close proximity to nightlife and public transport.

p2199
aVi am interested. would you be able to deliver?
p2200
aVpotentially, i could do that.
p2201
aVhow old is the set?
p2202
aVit actually is fairly new. it's 2 years old.
p2203
aVi would consider that. this set does include both the {title} and {title}, and the manufacturer is top-notch, creating sofas for crate and barrel and others, is made in america, with custom fabric. they are built to last a lifetime. as such, i'm wondering if you would come up a bit, such as to {price}? i'd be willing to deliver them to you at that price.

aVhello i am interested in your buying your {title}
p2207
aVsure, it is still available. would you like to come take a look?
p2208
aVyes sure you can you tell me more about it?
p2209
aVit's in great condition. we had it in our guest bedroom, so it's hardly used. we are turning the room into nursery, that's why we are selling it.
p2210
aVi can do {price}. it's practically in new condition. we paid over {price}
p2211
aVok i can do {price} that seems fair. i can come over later today to pick it up.
p2212
aVawesome.

aVmorning.
p2221
aVhow can i help you?
p2222
aVi see that you have this {title} for sale. how many people can it ft?
p2223
aVi've been able to get 10-12 around it with ease
p2224
aVoh that sounds great. can i offer {price} because of the crack?
p2225
aVhmmm ... where are you located? i'd be willing to drop the price to {price} and deliver it to you if you are reasonably close by.
p2226
aVwith delivery i'd give you the {my_price} i'm on the outskirts of the city.
p2227
aVok, that's plenty close. let's do the {my_price} with the included delivery. i think you'll really enjoy this {title}!
p2228

p2229
ag960
ag951
aVhey! i am very interested in the {title}. would you say it is more on the firm or soft side?
p2230
aVhey there, thanks for contacting me. i'd say it's more on the soft side. it has a {title} pillow top.
p2231
aVawesome, i definitely prefer soft. does it come with any sort of warranty?
p2232
aVi did originally purchase it with a warranty. it was a 5 year warranty, so there's a year and a half left.
p2233
aVmakes sense. does this include a boxspring as well?
p2234
aVoh yes. the boxspring is free.
p2235
aVwhat a deal! if i were to pick it up, would you be willing to take {price}?
p2236
aVhow about {price} because of the added warranty?

ag960
ag960
ag951
aVhi there, i was looking at your ad for the {title} you listed, about how old is it?
p2239
aVit is about 3 years old, but is in excellent condition. it has no stains or rips.
p2240
aVi was thinking about buying it for my nana, you know how old couches get a little soft and hard to get out of. are you sure you couldn't deliver? it would be a little difficult for me to pay so much and still have to pick it up, i mean, it's a 3 year old {title}.
p2241
aVi can not deliver, but i can give it to you for {price} if you pick it up.
p2242
aVi can not deliver, but i can give it to you for {price} if you pick it up.
p2243
ag960
ag951
aVhey so i'm interested in the closet rack, can you tell me about it?
p2244
aVsure! it's very sturdy and does not need to be attached to the wall as it has {title} feet. it's 10feet wide with 12'' and 16'' deep shelves. all together it's 83'' tall
p2245
aVhow's the condition, is it nice?
p2246
aVyes, it's in excellent condition, no rust or bending anywhere. perfect for a library!
p2247
aVis it already disassembled, or do i have to do that?
p2248
aVit's assembled and will fit in most pickup trucks, but if you need to dissasemble it, it's super easy to put back together.
p2249
aVok, but i'm looking to pay more towards {price} if i have to pick it up and do all of that myself. it looks huge.
p2250
aVthat's a little too low ... can we do {price} and i'll help you move it?
p2251
aVi think you'd need to do most of the work for that price, you could consider the extra {price} a delivery fee.
p2252

aVgood morning
p2254
aVhey there! what condition are the shelves in?
p2255
aVthey are in very good condition. i have used them in my food cellar for storage and they are nearly perfect.
p2256
aVwhat color are they? i can't really tell from the photo.
p2257
aVthey're kind of a dark gray ... along the lines of a slate. think of the color of a blackboard.
p2258
aVmakes sense. can they hold a lot of weight?
p2259
aVthe shelves are very stable. when i bought them, the packaging indicated that each shelve could hold up to 250 pounds.
p2260
aVexcellent. if i picked them up, would you be willing to let them go for {price}?
p2261
aVexcellent. if i picked them up, would you be willing to let them go for {price}?

aVit appears to be in pretty good condition from the photos but i'm not sure that i could come pick it up. i may have to rent a truck. would {price} sound good to you? i can provide cash.
p2265
aVit is in very good condition and is very comfortable. i do not think i can go that low. i will however throw in a warranty at {price}

p2271
aVit does have a lot of miles so i have it listed for {price} but will go to {price}
p2272
aVwhat if i paid with a bag full of cash? would that change the price?
p2273
aS'{price}'

p2275
aVyou might but i cant go lower than {price}

p2284

p2292
aVokay that sounds good. how many miles does it have on it?
p2293
aVit has {price}, 000 miles or so
p2294
aVwow that is a lot of miles for a {title}. can you go lower on the price?
p2295
aVit is a lot of miles but mostly highway. it's kept the engine really clean. i can come down in price. what number were you thinking?
p2296
aVcan you do {price}? since it's such high miles
p2297
aVi couldn't go that low. i'm more around 9500 bottom line

p2306
aVwould you be willing to take {price}? {title} is getting kind of old.

p2309
aVhi. just saw your ad and i'm very interested in your {title} set!
p2310
aVgreat, it is in great shape but i need the buyer to pick it up, would that be a problem?
p2311
aVhave you had it long? anything wrong with it? stains, scratches, etc.?
p2312
aVnope, no stains or scratches, it is in great shape and it is {title} so it really retains its value. haven't had it too long but i have taken very good care of it.
p2313
aVsounds good. {listing_price} is a bit over my budget, do you think you'd be able to take {price} for it? especially being that i need to haul it myself. i'll probably need to hire some help, so factoring that in to the cost.

aVi understand your phone is broken. can you pay {price}, and i will drop off the phone to you?
p2320
aVthe most i can really afford to pay is {price}.
p2321
aVwhat's wrong with your old phone? if the screen is just broken, i can get that fixed. i really feel for you and i want to make a deal. so if you give me your old phone, i can sell you the new phone for {price}. does that work?
p2322
ag951
aVi can not sell for that price, because i paid {price} for the battery originally. how about {price}. this is a really reliable product. do we have a deal?
p2323
aVwell, it is unopened. how about {price} if i come to you?

p2326
aVyes, i am interested in it. what canyou tell me about it and what price?
p2327
aVit is really an all around fitness bike with lots of bells and whistles. it has plenty of connections to things like heart rate monitors and computers. i need the cash, so i would be willing to sell it for {price}. deal?

aVi'm starting to think nothing will meet their `` acceptance criteria''.
p2330
aVoh, haha. so did you have any problems with this {title} when you used it?
p2331
aVit is unopened, so i did not use it.
p2332
aVoh cool. why are you selling it, did you get another one instead?
p2333
aVi was planning on using it for my phone, but my car has a usb port, so i decided i didn't need it.
p2334
aVwill you take {price} cash today?
p2335
aVi paid {price} for this, so i'm not going any lower than that, sorry.
p2336
aVif you throw in the original receipt, so i can have the warranty details, then we have a deal at {my_price}.
p2337
aVi do have the receipt, so that'll work. {my_price} it is.
p2338
ag960
ag951
aVsure thing. it is a brand new {title}. it is {title} and ready to go. selling for {listing_price} {title}
p2339
aVsince it's brand new, why are you selling it?
p2340
aVwon it in a contest and i am not an apple user.
p2341
aVok, makes sense. so, i would like to get it, but it's a bit too expensive for me. i would like to offer {price} for it.
p2342
aVcould you do {price}?
p2343

ag951
aVhi, i really like the bike and description. any way you would consider letting it go for {price}?
p2345
aV{my_price} is a tad too low, the listing price is {listing_price}. its a really well build bike and will help you achieve your fitness goals easier. would you be willing to pay {price} if i deliver it to your place for free?
p2346
aVi can pay {price} if you deliver and throw in a helmet and lock for the bike. deal?

ag960
ag951
aVi am interested in your device and would like to offer {price} cash for it.
p2349
aVi don't think i could go that low. its unopened and retails at {price}, so i think {listing_price} is a fair offer. i got it as a gift but already have one, trust me they're great and work super well. 6+ hours of battery life extra if you're using a tablet, 9 hours with a small tablet, and 24 hours extra with a smartphone. well worth {listing_price} imo.
p2350
aVi could offer {price}
p2351
aVi could offer {price}
p2352
ag960
aVthe most i could pay is {price}. are you willing to give a little? i can pay cash today.
p2353
aVno, i'm sorry. the best i can do is {listing_price} and i can deliver it to your house free of charge. thats the best you'll get from me.
p2354
aVguess we can't make a deal
p2355
aVokay, please reject my offer if you must.

p2425
aVyes. i see you have a {title} for {listing_price} dollars. that is a bit too much for me. can you lower your price a bit?
p2426
aVit is a nice {title} from a smoke free home. if you come to pick it up, i would reduce it down to {price} for you.
p2427
aVthat sounds good. how about {price} dollars then? that would be good for me, since i have to use gas to come and get it.

aVomg
p2435
aVhi! are you interested in mt {title}?
p2436
aVoh yes dear, my boyfriend and i loooooooove {title} sofas
p2437
aVit's in great shape, and has a {title} too. only {listing_price}.
p2438
aVwell sure only {listing_price} if your rich and gay, which i'm not, well one of those! lol
p2439
aVha! if you want, i can deliver for free.
p2440
aVhmz, well we are worried about if you had a cat or dog, i'm mean it's not a big deal, but ...
p2441
aVnope. i have no pets.
p2442
aVhave you ever had it cleaned? by a professional, honey?
p2443
aVno, but it's been kept clean, and it's only about a year old
p2444
aVok, but you know we are all a little dirty, especially on the {title}, or do you have kids in your place. i'm sorry, maybe this is a wholesome set of furniture ...
p2445
aVit's quite wholesome. how much are you willing to pay?
p2446
aVwell, since you said it's clean, and you'll deliver, and it's practically brand neeew, we'll give you {price}, and no we are straightedge, ha!
p2447
aVhow about {price}? it's really in great shape. no kids.
p2448
aVonly if you go on a date with us honey, never negotiate with a gay man, {price}.
p2449
aV{price} is as low as i can go.
p2450
aVoh i can't believe that, you got ta give me a reason, why are your credit cards so high? ok, {partner_price}, that's high enough ...
p2451
aVoh, it's not that i can't pay you {my_price}, but like i said we aren't rich. so we are willing to pay a fair price. really any material object is only worth 1 3 of the price of the list, especially after it's been used by any other person. therefore, technically, and reasonably i could only give you {price} in order for me to not be a foolish capitalist. so, giving you even {partner_price} with good humor is still way too much. so i'll double the reasonable offer a strong capitalist knows it is worth and give you {price}. you need it, you have to pay the divorcee.
p2452
ag951
aVwould you take {price}
p2453
aVhi, this is a great truck. {my_price} is too low. do you have a vehicle to trade with it? if so, tell me about that vehicle. i might be able to take {price} if you have a trade in.
p2454
aVhs this truck ever been in an accident?
p2455
aVno, it has never been in an accident. are you interested in buying it for {price}? or do you have a trade in?
p2456
aVno, to high, the truck does not have any additions, it is a plain fleet work truck and most likely doesn't even have power windows.
p2457
aVwhat about your trade in?
p2458
aVi can give you {price} or 2006 honda atv, perfect condition, clean title and new large tires.
p2459
aVokay. i will take the atv plus {price}. deal?
p2460
aVno, one or the other, the truck is not worth anything over {partner_price}
p2461
aVwell i am sorry. i can not take that deal. you are really trying to lowball me. please stop wasting my time and give me a fair offer.
p2462
aV{partner_price} firm, if not good luck trying to find someone to pay that much.
p2463
ag960
ag951
aVhi!
p2464
aVhey there, you're interested in the home?
p2465
aVyes i am. is it in good condition and everything?
p2466
aVdefinitely, we redid the carpet, floor, and the ceiling is pretty high. you're wanting to move in soon? in addition, there's a large front and back yard.
p2467
aVi would like to move in asap. but, would you be willing to lower the price a bit for me?
p2468
aVwell, i can't go too low. what's your budget? i don't think i could go below {price} considering it's a {title}
p2469
aVwould you be willing to lower it to {price}? it would help me out a bit as i am on a budget.
p2470
aVoh, yeah we can do {my_price} deal?
p2471
aVoh, yeah we can do {my_price} deal?
p2472
ag960
ag951

p2474
aVi have {price} cash. i can come pick it up today.
p2475
aVi have {price} cash. i can come pick it up today.
p2476
ag960
ag951
aVhello
p2477
aVhey, so you were thinking about a {title}?
p2478
aVyes, i am very interested.
p2479
aVoh, well that's cool. usually people see me and lowball me, i am obviously a gay surfer.
p2480
aVoh why would they do that? thats not fair
p2481
aVwell, surfers live in their cars in the search for the right wave, so this thing has some wear and tear. but, listen, i have to drive all over the place to get the best wave. so, you know i pay the best mechanics. i don't know anything about mechanical engineering.
p2482
aVsometimes, and this car has brought me lots of luck in the search. but, listen, i don't want you to think i'm a thief, i might be a pirate, but not a thief! lol, really, carfax is gonna tell you some mileage difference, it's because i bought a new engine off my bulgarian mechanic. he trained on the {title} race team in germany, look him up, stupid expensive. but this car will certainly get you where you need to go, and is the best {title} on any us coast.
p2483
aVtotally, it is super used, like i said. but that is why i have it listed so high. it was a long time ago, and i bought it for {price}, so i figured i would just cut a zero off. still, though it is used. i'll five it to you for less than {price}% of it's original tag, i'll give you this ride, for {price}. but, you may have to sell it back to me in a year. no, no, just kidding.
p2484
aVlol. come on! the price is still high. i will give you {price} right now for the car. i am ready to take it home with me right at this moment!
p2485
aVha, ok. it is high. but i'm not. how did you come up with {my_price}? you must be tired. listen, you can sleep in the back. i have many a time. i'll even give you my old yoga mat. ok, ok, {price}, lets do this!
p2486
ag951
aVhi, so i have an amazing {title} truck for sale. it's very tough and reliable.
p2487
aVwhat is your reason for selling this truck?
p2488
aVmy wife has been yelling at me to get a minivan and i can't afford both insurance payments.
p2489
aVi am interested, but {listing_price} is too high of a price for a 10 year old truck. i have {price} cash in my hand. i could come and pick it up right now and take it off your hands
p2490
aVit only has 173k the price is already low. i can knock {price} off if you can meet me later today.
p2491
aV173k miles on a {title} really is a lot of miles, the most i can offer is {price} cash
p2492
aV{title}'s are built to last! {price} and you have a deal.
p2493
aVat {price} can you include a full tank of gas? i'm ready to head over right now

aVindeed i do. would you like it?
p2574
aVi'm definitely interested. but i'm concerned about the quality. you said in the ad you had to rebuild it?
p2575
aVyeah, it's been through a lot. that's why i'm offering it for so cheap, only {listing_price} bucks
p2576
aVthat's still a bit higher than what i wanted to spend. would you take {price} for it? i'll even come by with a pick up truck and pick it up myself.
p2577
aVhmm, really was hoping for a bit more, but i can go for {price} if you pay in two 20s. easier to get from the atm anyway:)

aVit has never been used. the store had a deal buy a camera get the {title} free. i took it out of the box, but to be honest my other {title} is better so i never even used this one.
p2580
aVit looks nice. i have a {title} camera so it will sync and work well with the common software. i'll give you {price} bucks
p2581
aVwell i can do {my_price} or if you would like, i have {title} paper that goes with it was part of the package too. i can throw that in if you will do {listing_price} the paper alone was {listing_price}

p2584
aVi can go down a little bit but not much. it's still in great condition and i barely used it at all.
p2585
aVwould you take {price} if i come and pick it up?
p2586
aVi think {price} would be more fair since i already lowered the price when i listed the {title} again. how's that sound?
p2587
aVthrow in a {title} helmet and we have deal.
p2588
aVsure i can throw in my helmet no problem! we have a deal.

p2592
aVyes i just had a couple questions. are pets allowed? and does it come with appliances?
p2593
aVit does come with a washer and dryer in the unit. the stove, fridge and microwave are also included. we do allow outdoor pets.
p2594
aVokay is there any way you can bring the price down?
p2595
aVit is in a very great location, and has new flooring. so i do not want to go too low, i think {price} is reasonable

p2600
aVit is made of oak and chrome with a dark finish. it is about 6.5 feet tall and in perfect condition
p2601
aVi'd really like to have it but my budget is around {price} could you lower the price at all?
p2602
aVokay i think i could come up with maybe another {price} would you take {price}? it would be coming to a good home to someone who really appreciates it!
p2603

aVhello there, are you still selling the {title}?
p2617
aVi don't think you'll have any issues with the {title}. this table's {title} unscrew so that you can transport it, but they tighten down quite nicely.
p2618
aVokay does it come with the swivel chair in the picture?
p2619
aVi can throw in the chair with the table. but i would ask for {listing_price} for both items.

aVhi, is the house still for rent?
p2622
aVyes it is still available.
p2623
aVgreat! but i'm going to be honest. {listing_price} is a bit steep for me. can you work with me on the price?
p2624
aVi can work with you on the price a little bit but within reason. it's a nice place and it's in a good neighborhood as well.
p2625
aVi understand, but i'm on a really tight budget right now. i honestly can afford much more than {price} a month.
p2626
aV{my_price} is out of the question, are you sure this is in your price range? i can come down to {price}.
p2627
aVwell the place is kind of big. would you be open to letting me sublet? i can probably get 3 other people to rent the place with me so i can stay in budget and still get you {my_price} a month.
p2628
aVyes that would be possible, so we have a deal at {my_price}?

aVhello, you are here about my {title} posting?
p2631
aVyes i am. would you accept {price} for your phone?
p2632
aVhmm ... {my_price} seems a little low considering it's condition.
p2633
aVi would be willing to pick it up, and i could pick it up in an hour.
p2634
aVthat sure would make things more convenient. how about i take {price} off of it since you're ready to buy.
p2635
aVlets call it {price} and i'll head over right now. does that work?
p2636
aVthat sounds good to me! i had a case with it but i was going to sell it separately. how about i throw that in as well since we were able to come to such a good deal?

p2641
aVsure it's approx. 7 feet tall and it's brown oak drifted color finish.
p2642
aVand is it in pretty good condition?
p2643
aVyes, no damage at all.
p2644
aVi know you are asking {listing_price} for it but i also noticed that you have had this ad up for over a month so i was hoping that you would be willing to take {price} for it? i could come get it right away.
p2645
aVi would be willing to take {price} and i'll help you load it up when you come.

p2650
aVi'm giving you a good offer, lowest i can go is {price}
p2651

p2661
aVi was hoping to get if for less than {listing_price} but the ink carts sound pretty good. i can do the {listing_price} if you would be willing to meet me somewhere in between both our locations possibly?

p2664
aVwhat would you like to know?
p2665
aVim glad you have a {title}, but i'm curious, how many miles does the truck have?
p2666
aVi don't honestly know off the top of my head
p2667
aVwell, shoot. what are you asking for it?
p2668
aS'{listing_price}'
p2669
aVshesh, that is a little steep for such an old truck. could i meet you in the {price} range?
p2670
aVthe lowest i could go is {price}. its in good condition.
p2671
aVyou say that, but i can see in the picture that the right blinker is held on with duct tape, let alone the dint in the side. i thought you would jump at such an offer.
p2672
aVit's a good truck. the kbb value is {price}. {partner_price} is more than a fair price. i'm selling not giving it away
p2673
aVi was just looking for something to give to my son ... i'm not trying to break the bank. could we agree on {price}?
p2674
aVhow about {price}
p2675

p2685
aVhello, so i take it that you are very interested in buying this newly {title} apartment?
p2686
aVyes, but the price you have listed is quite high.
p2687
aVyes, but the price you have listed is quite high.
p2688
aVhello, so i take it that you are very interested in buying this newly {title} apartment?
p2689
aVi do like the proximity to whole foods, but the unit doesn't have its own laundry room, i would have to share the on-site one.
p2690
aVok, does {price} sound fair?
p2691
aVi think that's still too high. consider that i'm only getting one bedroom, so i don't even have space for guests.

p2695
aVare you able to offer any other amenities or incentives for that price?
p2696
aVi can throw in free cable tv.
p2697
aVyou make a tempting offer. my budget is pretty tight though, would you be able to knock it down to {price} for that deal?

p2702
aVyes it is!
p2703
aVhow many miles?
p2704
aVit is actually pretty low mileage, my grandmother only drove it to church on sundays. church wasn't very far, so it only has 15,000 miles on it. such a deal!
p2705
aVpretty cool grandma to be riding in a {title}
p2706
aVyeah, i come from a long line of rabble-rousers! we originally got it for her for her rabbit farm, but she kept bring the bunnies in the house and not selling them. did you need a bunny with the truck?
p2707
aVi don't need a bunny but is your grandma single? how about i take her out for a nice steak dinner and give you {price} for the truck?
p2708
aVsorry, grandma is a vegetarian and she needs more than that. she just received her medical marijuana farming license and there are a lot of start up costs. although, you can become one of her `` special'' customers and get a deal on the new crop. grandma can grow anything.( we are still recovering from the zucchini incident).
p2709
aVwould you accept {price} and i'll give her 100 sensi star clones

aVhello
p2711
aVhi there, i am interested in buying your {title}. how old is it?

aVit's only 3 months old practically like new. i even have a side table to go wtih it that i'll throw in free
p2713
aVhave the items been around pets? i have some allergies.
p2714
aVpet free, smoke free home
p2715
aVi appreciate your offer but i don't really have space for a table, my unit is pretty small. would you be willing to knock the price of the {title} down to {price} without the table?
p2716
aV{my_price} is lower than i'd like to go. how about we meet in the middle at {price}?
p2717

p2722
aVit's in excellent condition. one owner household, one person sleeping on it with minimal ware. no stains or discolorations. it's a beautiful {title} pillowtop.
p2723
aVhow old is it?
p2724
aVi purchased it in december of 2013 so about 3.5 yrs.
p2725
aVokay so it is kind of old. would you take {price} for it?
p2726
aVi'll take {price} cash if you pick it up.
p2727

aVyes. i can give you {price} cash today.
p2731
aVehh, that is way too low for me. what could i do to get you home in this car for at least {price}?
p2732
aVwill you accept {price}? that's stretching it for me. the car is almost 10 years old.
p2733
aVnearly 10 years yes, but the car only has 10,000 miles, there isnt a scratch on it. with the ammount of money you will save in this {title} you could easily pay the full price, and have money to spare ... i guess i could go lower, but honestly {price} is the best i can do.

p2746

p2769
aVi was thinking maybe around {price}
p2770
aVoh wow. that's much lower than i anticipated. i am trying to get rid of it, but i'd also not like to lose out on it. how about {price}?
p2771
aVi could go {price} and pick it up.
p2772
aV{partner_price} is the lowest i'm willing to go. it's a great phone and {partner_price} is a steal!
p2773
aVdoes it come with the charger and any accessories?

p2786
aVit appears scratched, but works great!
p2787
aVhonestly i just need a bike to be able to get to work right now. someone stole my car which had my purse and all my stuff in it i have been down on my luck and this bike sounds perfect. how low are you willing to go?
p2788
aVoh, i'm so sorry! it's such a great bike, that i have been re-building. could you buy it for {price}?
p2789
aVi could, but then i wouldn't have enough money for food this week since my purse was stolen too. would you mind accepting {price} i really wouldn't usually ask but considering my situation i could really use the help.
p2790
aVthat is a bit too low, but, i'm willing to meet in the middle. how about {price}?

p2804
aVit does come with washer and dryer. about 1 mile from supermarket, flooring is hardwood and new carpet.
p2805
aVthat's good. the house is kind of in a bad part of town so i think it's a little overpriced are you flexible at all when it comes to the price?
p2806
aVit is located in a good part of the neighborhood, and might give some consideration to price, though it is certainly comparable to other rates in this neighborhood.
p2807
aVwill you take {price} that's kind of where my budget is right now
p2808
aVsorry, bout couldn't go that low. could go down to {price}.
p2809
aVi can come up to {price} if you throw in utilities that possible?

p3153
aVi'm sorry, but i can't let it go for that little. i would get more if i donated it and took it off my taxes. would {price} work for you?
p3154
aVi understand that. if you could bring it to me so i dont have to pay anyone to help me haul it then, i could give {my_price} for it. did your sister leave behind her ideas or materials to finish the project?
p3155
aVsure, i can bring it to you and give you some of the materials she had purchased for the {title} for you to use. so we agree on {my_price}?

p3178
aVit has much wear and tear, it's a pretty beat up old thing.
p3179
aVhmm ... i know {listing_price} is cheap but can you do {price} because of the condition?
p3180
aVi suppose so, but you would have to pick it up.

aVany questions?
p3246
aVhow is the engine?
p3247
aVit's in great shape, it hums quietly. my son says there aren't any major issues with it, the only minor issue is the airbag light comes one and stays on every once in a while.
p3248
aVoh that's ok. my old car's engine light says on all the time even though the engine is fine. what year model is it?
p3249
aVyeah, i had a car like that and they could never find anything wrong with it. this is a {title}.
p3250
aVhow is the air conditioner because it is so hot now and my current car's air don't work.

aVhello. are you interested in the car?
p3264
aVhi! yep, is it in good condition?
p3265
aVyes, everything runs like new. i replaced everything specifically to sell it, so no need to fix or replace everything. i did an oil change, got the timing belt checked out, added new tires and rim, and a lot of other stuff.
p3266
aVthat sounds great. but i see in the description that the airbag light is on, will probably cost me a few hundred to get that checked. would you be willing to come down on price a bit?
p3267
aVi can get that looked at and fixed for you if you'd like.
p3268
aVokay, so the listing is at {listing_price}. what do you say if i pay {price} in cash today and pick up the car myself, no need to even check the airbag light?

aVnice! if you're price is negotiable, i have {price} cash today and could come pick up the furniture at your convenience.
p3862
aVthe tables are in excellent condition. how about {price}?
p3863
aVi'm sure they are nice but that is just out of my budget right now. i can probably come up with {price}.
p3864
aVok how about {price} for the table and chairs. i'll keep the coffee table and end tables.
p3865
ag960
ag951
aVhi there how are you?
p3866
aVthe {title} is in {title} condition and selling because i am moving and can't take it with me. the frame is smaller with 20'' wheels and asking {listing_price} for it!
p3867
aVokay sounds good! would you be willing to take {price} for it if i swing by in about 30 minutes to pick it up with cash?

p3872

p3874
ag960
aVhi, i ahve a {title} cast iron {title} and i think this will fit perfectly. i wonder how much rust there is?
p3875
aVhello i have kept this in very good condition there are no scratches. it has a shiny black glossy finish
p3876
aVit looks great, would you be willing to ship it. it's a bit far to drive for something so small. also would you take {price} for it?
p3877
aVi was thinking of {listing_price} since it is in great condition.
p3878
aVsplit the difference at {price}?
p3879
aVok, i will accept your offer for {my_price}
p3880
ag960
ag951
aVhi:-) what kind of shape is this in?
p3881
aVit's still in very good shape. i've only used it for basic road riding. no competitions or anything too intense.
p3882
aVnice:-) so no rusty bits or problems with chains or gears? i like why your're selling it, btw
p3883
aVthanks. yeah, no mechanical issues or worn out parts. it was a classic design, and i did my best to take care of it.
p3884
aVi understand they have different sizes for these bikes? i'm on the short side, would it work for me?
p3885
aVit's a 55 cm frame, which is designed for people5'6'' to5'9'', but of course you can adjust the handlebar and seat height to your preferences.
p3886
aVperfect, sorry about the dumb question. its listed for {listing_price}, but i only have a budget of {price}, could that work?
p3887
aVi think i could probably go {price}. would that work?
p3888
aVit's for such a good cause, i can't go as high as five though( i'm sorry) but i do have my mad money:-) it's not much, but i can get together {price} ...
p3889
aVi think that'll work for me. you seem like you're going to give it a great home.
p3890
aVi think that'll work for me. you seem like you're going to give it a great home.
p3891
ag960
ag951
aVhi. i'm very much interested in your vette. but the price is a bit high for my wallet. could you go down to about {price}?
p3892
aVi would have to get a bit more than that. it has low miles and lots of extras!
p3893
aVi do see it has a lot of aftermarket additions ... would you at least be able to meet me in the middle between your listing price and my offer?
p3894
aVhow does {price} sound? it's really a very nice car and you won't be disappointed.
p3895
aVif you can do {price} i'll come write you the check today and we'd have a deal.
p3896
aVyou've got a deal!
p3897
ag960
ag951
aVhi! i'm interested in your {title}. is it in good condition?
p3898
aVit is is good condition. i am a bigger person and since one of the cushions is attached it makes the seat a little smaller than i was wanting, so this is why i am selling.
p3899
aVwell, i'm happy you are. could you maybe come down a little on the price? its a gift for my grandmother. is {price} acceptable?
p3900
aVi would love to be able to sell it for that but to replace this with another {title} in my house i am needing at least {price}. i could deliver today.
p3901
aVwould you consider {price} if i come get it?

p3910
aVwe have had it for 7 years, it's 7 years old. we bought it brand new from a local artisan. it's very sturdy. they don't build them like this any more.
p3911
aVit's a unique looking piece, which is part of why i'm so interested. i've never seen one like it before. has it ever been painted?
p3912
aVno, this is the original stain there are only a few scratches on the top
p3913
aVexcellent. i would have lost all interest if it had been painted. my mother always told me never to pay full price. {price}?
p3914
aVi can do {price}.
p3915
aV{price}, sorry, i can sell it for {price}
p3916
aVwell you give in just a little more and go {price}?

p3919
ag960
ag951
aVi'm really interested in the bike. you say it has less than 50 miles on it. how long have you owned it?
p3920
aVhi:-) it's an awesome bike, i've had it two years, i keep it in the garage and its in tip top shape!
p3921
aVi want the bike cut can't afford the {listing_price}, i can pay {price}
p3922
aVoh man, i am so sorry, i can't come down that low on it. i would maybe consider that a down payment, and we can do payments on it, if you're really serious.
p3923
aVi could do that.
p3924
aVokay, so let's say the {my_price} is the first payment, and that leaves another {my_price} due. how about two hundred a month? could you work that okay?

p3934
aVyes i am! can you tell me how many people it can sit?
p3935
aVok great, i need {price} so that will work! {listing_price} is a little out of my price range. i'm assuming it is pretty heavy, i can come get it and load it myself tonight if you'd be willing to accept {price}.
p3936
aVi could do {price}! it also comes with 2 end tables and a coffee table. they are all in beautiful shape and barely used.
p3937
aVthat is great! i'm really not looking for a coffee table, but i'm sure they are also very nice. can we do {price}? i'm already over my budget i agreed on with my husband ...

p3950
aVwould you accept {price} for it?
p3951
aVi don't think i could go that low. i am asking {listing_price} and this is a really great piece of japanese worksmanship.
p3952

p3953
aVi mean ... you're just throwing numbers at me ... i am asking {listing_price}. i can take {price} off if you come pick it up tonight and pay cash. but that's about all i can do.

p3957
aVyes it is. it is in great shape. i just don't have any need for it anymore.

p3976
aVi was hoping to give you {price} and then i may have some items that you would like that i could throw in to make it a fairer deal for you.
p3977
aVfirst i need to make sure that just because you won't pay a higher price you won't value it at a higher price. this car has to go to someone who will take good care of it and keep it in good condition
p3978
aVoh i see the value and should say that i love cars and treat them very nicely!
p3979
aVokay, what else do you have to offer me?
p3980
aVwell i have a john boat and also some tools and i have some other things, is there anything in particular that you would want?
p3981
aVnothing that i can think of that's worth {price}
p3982
aVokay i didn't really want to part with this but i see that you're looking for something very special and rare. i just so happen so have something that you may consider. these are special herbs from overseas and you can not get them in usa. these are coming from an ancient culture of indigenous peoples. i met the shaman of the people and he gifted for me several pounds of this different types of herbs, i could part myself with 2lbs of this one that is very good for you and then give you {price}? will this work for you?
p3983
aV{my_price} and the tools, do you have a hydraulic jack or a welder?
p3984

p4005
aVwow, that's incredible. how firm is that price?

p4015
aVwell if you are willing to sign a 2 year lease i can reduce the price by {price} which would make it {price} a month.
p4016
aVi plan on staying in this area for quite awhile. what could you do for a 5 year lease with 2 months rent up front?
p4017
aVwith a 5 year lease i could go down as low as {price} a month but that is the lowest that i am able to go. would that work for you?

aVits says fair condition, any scuffs or scratches in the wood?
p4037

p4052
aVyes! i love the location of it and the access to everything. my only problem though is that i think {listing_price} is a lot for what looks like a small space, would you consider lowering the price?
p4053
aVwell the price is because of its amazing location and {title} views. it is also fully remodeled and new carpet new paint
p4054
aVi do like all of that, like i said though i could only afford a reduced price, like 1500-1900.
p4055
aVthe lowest i'm allowed to offer is {price}
p4056
aVyou know what, that's fine. i will do {my_price} if thats fine with you since i'm so excited about your views and location.

p4061
aVoh sorry, it doesn't say that on my end. could you tell me a little about the single item in the green box that says `` snap''?
p4062
aVto be honest, i purchased the item as a bulk deal and haven't used the item. it comes as a bonus along with the selfie clicker and wall chargers.
p4063
aVoh these are all sold together i thought they were individual. i was going to offer {listing_price} for a selfie clicker and wall charger

p4082
aVideally i would like to pay {price} for this. it is an older used {title}, the fact that it is super rare makes it harder to get any parts for it and i will have to deal with possible tire dry rot and anything else wrong with it.

p4401
aVyes, the {title} is still available. would you be interested?

aVis it just the one bedroom? all i saw was the master bedroom listed.
p4403
aVyes, it only has a master bedroom, but it is exceptional.
p4404
aVis there any wiggle room on the price? i found another apartment {title} to this but it was about {price} cheaper. i'm trying to do some research.
p4405
aVyeah, i could come down a bit, what are you thinking?
p4406
aVi was hoping to do all in {price}( water and trash included).
p4407
aVthat's a bit lower than i can go, everything is up to date and it's {title} to a lot of sites. i was originally looking to get {listing_price}. you seem like you would be a great fit for the apartment. how about {price}?
p4408
aVsorry, that's a bit more than i can afford at this time. thank you though.
p4409
aVi could even go as low as {price}, if that would help you out.
p4410
aVthank you for the offer, i'd need to stay below {my_price} a month with utilities, so unfortunately i don't think it will be a good fit. it's a beautiful place though!

p4472
aVhello, is the {title} still available?
p4473
aVyes, it is. would you like to see it?
p4474
aVbefore i see it, i have a few questions. are any utilities included in the rent. {listing_price} is a bit much and are pets allowed?
p4475
aVno, utilities are not included, and small pets are allowed with a pet deposit. keep in mind that you could have 18 or more people sharing the rent, depending on how you furnish the bedrooms, so that brings down the per-person price a lot!
p4476
aVyeah, more people equals less per person, but i don't want too big a crowd. some people just aren't clean. how about we start out at {price} for 5 people and renegotiate later if i need to bring more people in?
p4477
aVthat's less than half price! my boss would kill me! i can't go lower than {price}. how many people you share with is up to you.
p4478
aVokay, i'm just trying to save you the eviction process if we can't pay. i think i can find {price} more people and get you {my_price} but we'll need water and gas covered.

aVyes, but it's dirty, there isn't xm in the radio, and its only a 5 speed. the gas mileage is also very low on this vehicle, so how about {price}?
p6072
aVi'd be willing to go down to {price} because i like you, but i can't go any lower.
p6073
aVthe highest i am willing to go is {price}. cash in hand. i can pick it up in 10 minutes.

aVthat's a nice starting point. however, i have many interested buyers. i will counter at {price}
p6096
aVokay, since i really liked the apartment, i would be willing to give that amount.
p6097

p6099
aVthis house looks perfect! is there a basement?
p6100
aVunfortunately there is not a basement.
p6101
aVwell is there anyway you could allow me to bring my cat along? i know you said no pets but i don't want to get rid of him
p6102
aVonce again. i am sorry, but i can't allow pets at this location. even the best pets do have occasional `` accidents'' and with this carpet can be very difficult to clean. i certainly hope this isn't a deal breaker to you, but i understand if it is.
p6103
aVif you could lower the price to {price} i would still take it.
p6104
aVi have decent credit but i just broke up with my boyfriend and all i can afford right now is to pay a little over {my_price} i really need a place to live.
p6105
aVi understand, if you don't mind me asking, what is your current source of income?
p6106
aVi am a school teacher.
p6107
aVthank you for letting me know. i appreciate the work you do. you have been very pleasent during this process. i'm willing to go down to {partner_price} in this situation. assuming that you pass the credit check, which i'm sure that you will, we can get the lease agreement sorted out in about a week or so.
p6108
aVthank you so much you won't regret this!
p6109
aValright. it sounds like {my_price} is a deal. thank you for your time.

aVso, what's wrong with this phone?
p6112
aVit starts but won't go past the boost screen. i am no phone expert though.
p6113
aVwell, i think we can make a deal, i would like to buy the phone on the chance i can get it to work again.
p6114
aVgreat. how much would you like to offer.
p6115
aVwell, are there any other problems with the phone besides the boot screen problem you mentioned?
p6116
aVnone i know. i am not an expert though. i just buy phones. never fixed one myself.
p6117
aVwould you be willing to do {price}?
p6118
aVno, i have to stay firm at {my_price}, there's a good chance that the phone is in a permanent bootloop state that i can't do anything to recover, and then i'd have to just recycle it.
p6119
aVcan we meet in the middle at {price}?
p6120
aVi'll do {price}, that's my best offer.
p6121
aVok sounds good.

p6123
aVhi how's it going
p6124
aVhello. i'm well. i hope you are too. i'd love to get this car but i can't afford the listed price. what deal can you make for cash?
p6125
aVwhat is your offer?
p6126
aVi can take if off your hands for {price} cash in hand. the car is nearing 100000 miles and i think it's a fair price for cash.
p6127
aVits still got about 16k miles until 100k. how about we meet in the middle?
p6128
aVwhat would be your counter offer? it's no hot rod.
p6129
aV{price} cash?
p6130
aVi don't have that much cash. that's pretty far from the middle. what about {price}?
p6131
aV{price} is as low as i can go.
p6132
aV{partner_price} is reasonable. deal.
p6133
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p6134
aVhi. do you have a picture of this item? i'm very interested.
p6135
aVno dio not have a picture of it. but i can tell you in very good condition
p6136
aVokay. how wide is the shelf?
p6137
aVit is wide enough to hold books and other items
p6138
aVdo you have exact measurements?
p6139
aVno i do not have exact measurements but it is a reproduction of the french original
p6140
aVokay. how much are you looking to sell it for?
p6141
aVlist price is {listing_price} but am willing to negoitate
p6142
aVokay good. how does {price} sound? i can pay cash and pick it up today or tomorrow.
p6143
aVhello! what do you think of the apartment?
p6144
aVhi, i'm interested in it. do you think we could maybe do {price} for the place.
p6145
aVthe apartment is newly renovatedand in such a {title} neighborhood. how do you feel about {price}?
p6146
aV{partner_price} still seems too much for the place given the fact that i have to use coins to use the laundry. can we met half way at {price}?
p6147
aV{price} and you have yourself a deal.
p6148
aS'{price}'
p6149
aV{price} and i can throw in some nice lavender linen spray
p6150
aVhmm i'm not really interested in that, i would prefer 2150
p6151
aV{partner_price} will be acceptable.welcome to your new apartment!

aVhi i am interesed in the chair your have sale but i want to know some details. i am 6ft 5in and weigh 250lbs. will this hold me?
p6154
aVwell, good thing you asked because this chair is just the right {title} for you if you are over 6ft.
p6155
aVsweet! would you be willing to take {price} for the chair?
p6156
aVtruth be told. my initial sale price for this is much, much higher. it's {price}. we need to talk this out.
p6157
aVwell they list at office max for {listing_price} and this one is used. so the highest i would go is about {price}
p6158
aVmore accurately, though, this is refurbished. i only `` unboxed'' the package, and intermittently used it. meaning the quality of it is still considerably higher than a used chair. {partner_price} is severely underselling it. i want {price} because the condition is too close to new.
p6159
aVim sorry i can not go that high {price} is im highest offer take it or leave it
p6160
aVi have a counteroffer. {price} is the absolute lowest i can go on my part. if you buy a used chair anywhere else, it will not be as great of a condition as this.

p6162
ag1113
aVhi, how much would you like to spend for this item?
p6163
aVi am looking to spend no more than {price}
p6164
aVokay, are you willing to go a bit higher for a quality place?
p6165
aVmaybe, if pets were allowed.
p6166
aVunfortunately no pets allowed
p6167
aVthen my price is not adjustable unfortunately.
p6168
aVokay, the lowest i can go is {price}
p6169
aVnot {my_price}?
p6170
aVno, only {my_price}

p6172
aVhow new are the {title} and bathroom?
p6173
aVboth have been redone in the past year.
p6174
aVdoes the bathroom have a shower and a bath?
p6175
aVyes.
p6176
aVand could you tell me what color it is?
p6177
aVthe bathroom is pained white, and the combo shower bath is also white.
p6178
aVsweet. is there anyway you'd allow me to bring my dog? i swear she never pees in the house.
p6179
aVsorry, i can't make any exceptions to the no pets rule.
p6180
aVi'd really only like to pay {price} then.
p6181
aVis that for any of the local businesses or just one in particular?
p6182
aVit is for any local business.
p6183

aVhi there i am interested in your car ...
p6187
aVgreat! it is very well maintained and has a lot of added features. my asking price for it is just {price}
p6188
aVhow old is this car?
p6189
aVits a {title}, its an le edition, and the brakes were just replaced, so its a great deal.
p6190
aVhas it ever been in an accident?
p6191
aVno accidents and it has all the papers with it.
p6192
aVif you could come down a little to say {price}, i would take it happily.
p6193
aVi think you will like this car an i want to sell it to you, so how about i meet you half way and we settle for {listing_price}
p6194
aVthe listing price is {listing_price}.
p6195
aVi feel that it is worth more than {listing_price} the listing price is the lowest i can go.
p6196
aVwell you should have placed the add differently. i don't feel you open to offers then.
p6197
aVok sorry we couldnt agree
p6198
ag960
aS'<reject>'
p6199
aVthis great {title} is going for {listing_price}!
p6200
aVthere are no washer dryer. i would consider it if you can make an offer of {price}
p6201
aVthat depends on how your credit is?
p6202
aVmy credit would be excellent with no doubt.
p6203
aVand you would be able to pay that with no problem if i gave you that deal?
p6204
aVcertainly.
p6205
aVthen you have yourself a deal.

p6211
aVhave the tires been changed recently?
p6212
aVall weather tires were put on 3months ago.
p6213
aVjust one last question then. how is the oil?
p6214
aVjust changed.
p6215
aVi'd like to offer you {price} for this
p6216
aVthat is a little low but wan to take care of this quickly, how about {price}?
p6217
aVi think i can work with that. deal!
p6218
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p6219
aVget this car for the low price of {listing_price}.
p6220
aVi really liked the car but the price is way too high for me
p6221
aVwell i did some research and this is what most cars like this had been selling for. i thought it was a fair price.
p6222
aVi don't think its a fair price. i would appreciate it if you could reconsider the price. is the car used?
p6223
aVit is used. but it only has 15000 miles on the engine.
p6224
aVi am interested in it, but it only fits my budget if i can pay {price}?
p6225
aVwould you not be able to do at least {price}?
p6226
aVokay, i could do {partner_price} but i need more details about the car though please!
p6227
aVwell it is in excellent condition. it was 3 rows of seats, and if you don't need them they can fold down for storage.
p6228
aVgreat thanks. so do you accept cash or credit?
p6229
aVi prefer cash if you have it.
p6230
aVsure thing we got a deal! thanks

p6232
aVhello there! this is a very elegant piece of furniture. are you interested in purchasing it
p6233
aVyes i really like it
p6234
aVokay what do you want to know?
p6235
aVhow good is its condition?
p6236
aVits in a very good condition
p6237
aVhow about the price?
p6238
aV{listing_price} is the price
p6239
aVare you gonna come down alittle?
p6240
aVi can do {price}
p6241
aVnothing less than that?
p6242
aVno that's the last i could do because i assure you that you won't regret this purchase!
p6243
aVand will you be delivering it?
p6244
aVi don't do delivery but in your case i could do that for you!
p6245
aVthen {partner_price} sounds good thank you.
p6246
ag960
aVwe got a deal! you're very welcome! thanks for purchasing with me!
p6247
aS'<accept>'
p6248
aVhello i am interested in buying.
p6249
aVgreat! i am listing this at {listing_price}
p6250
aVi'm going to be honest with you, i am very very limited by my budget ... i hope we can negotiate a fair price ...
p6251
aVthat sounds great. that countertop looks very outdated. i am stuck at {price} but if the countertop was updated i could probably go much higher ...
p6252
aVwell, we are not finished updating just yet.we still have to do the kitchen. it's available on july 1st so we still have some time to replace it. what's the highest you think you could go?
p6253
aVi think {price} would be fair with a new countertop.
p6254
aVi really couldn't let it go for less than the {listing_price} asking price. i am remodeling more than just the counter. new carpet, new appliances, freshly painted and i put in an energy efficient hvac so your utility bills will be lower.
p6255
aVthat all sounds great but like i said i am limited by a very very low budget. i can forego the new countertop though if it means a fairer price.
p6256
ag960
aVhow would you feel if i waived the first month's rent, but you have to agree to a {price} month lease?
p6257
aVi can't go any higher than {my_price} and i didn't think you were coming back so i submitted it as my final offer.
p6258
aVi think with this location and the remodel's i'm putting in to it, i can't go 500 lower, so i'll have to reject your offer. thank you for your interest, though.
p6259
aVthanks for considering it. have a good night.

aVi can do {price} a month with the first month free and no deposit.
p6265
aVi see ... i am sorry i was looking in the low {price}'s ... i will have to look somewhere else then
p6266
aVyou won't find anything below {price} in {title} creek.
p6267
aVok that is clearly out of my price range. i have {price} cash i was looking to pay up front as 1st and last so i will have to look elsewhere

aVthe cars color is desert sand mica
p6274
aVokay and how about the smog test?
p6275
aVit just passed the smog test and it totally ready to go! asking {my_price}
p6276
aVyou're asking {partner_price} for it?
p6277
aVyes we are!
p6278
aVwoah! that's too too much for me!
p6279
aVwell, we may have a little wiggle room, so please make an offer. maybe we can find a price that works for the both of us.
p6280
aVwell as per your ad, the listing item is for {listing_price}. i wonder why you're asking {my_price}?
p6281
aVwell, we have others that are interested in the vehicle as well. so due to popular inquiry, we had to raise the price. i am waiting to hear back from two clients. but if you can agree to purchase the vehicle i will sell it to you!
p6282
aVas per your listing price, i am willing to pay {price}?
p6283
aVthat is 1800 below my price!! how about we meet in the middle and agree at {price}?
p6284
aVhow about {price}?
p6285
aVok, if you are willing to make that our final agreement, then i will accept!

p6292
aVthe lowest i can go is {price} the first month is free and i will pay the first months utility.
p6293
aVthats a great deal but i really can't afford {partner_price} would you consider {price}
p6294
aVmy bottom line is {my_price} with a free month and all fees waived plus the utilities for a month. i will leave the deposit off as well.
p6295

aVwill you pick it up?

p6302
aVok, that will be fine {title} i know it is in good hands!
p6303
aS'<accept>'
p6304
aVi will offer you this {title} for {listing_price}
p6305
aVwhat are your thoughts on taking less? i've been thinking of getting one, but that's kinda pricey.
p6306
aVi am willing to negotiate.
p6307
aVi found a different one that i think i could probably make do with for {price}, but if i could get what i really want for not much more than that, it would totally be worth it.
p6308
aVwell it is in the original box and has a 1 year factory warranty. what about {price}?
p6309
aVi was hoping closer to {price}?
p6310
aVit is in very good condition. how about {price}?
p6311
aVyeh, i'm not that into it. i think i'd go {price}, but that's my max.
p6312
aVwell i do have another buy that seems interested. are you sure you can't go {my_price}?
p6313
aVnah. the {title} is a good one, but i don't know that it's worth {price} more than the one that will do. it's getting stuck in the back of a closet... sell me with some amazing facts, or {my_price} is the magic number.

p6315

p6316
aVgreat! i'm asking {listing_price} per month. utilities aren't included, so you would also be responsible for those as well.
p6317

p6328
aVof course. the shipping will be done by a private shipping company which provides a fantastic service. any damages per delivery will be covered by us.
p6329
aVthat is great; i'm glad to hear it. what would you think of an offer of {price} for the item?
p6330
aVi'm very sorry, but that is simply too low for such a fantastic and original item. this is an exact reproduction of the french original, and you will not buy anywhere else in america.
p6331
aVunderstandable. what are you expecting for the item?
p6332
aVwell the full price of the item is {listing_price} dollars, and this is including our fantastic shipping option, covered by a non-damage warranty. i am willing to lower my price a bit but i can't go too low. would {price} dollars be acceptable to you?
p6333
aVi'm willing to meet you in the middle since it is an exceptional item, but my budget is a bit tight. how about {price}?
p6334
aVsadly i simply can not go under the mark of {price} dollars.
p6335
aVlast offer, i can do {price} max.
p6336
aVi thank you for your interest, but as i stated above, i can not go under {my_price} for this spectacular item. my offer is {my_price} if you can accept it.

p6342
aVi can not do that at that price
p6343
aVwhy not? it's fully loaded, and there's really nothing wrong.
p6344
ag960
ag1284
aVhi there. how can i help you?
p6345
aVi am interested in the phone. you say it is in good condition?
p6346
aVyes absolutely its in a very good condition. it has no sratches or cracks or scuffs of any sort. i have always used it with a screen protector
p6347
aVis the interface still quick? is the phone still up to date as far as updates?
p6348
aVyes absolutely the interface is quick and the phone is up to date as far the updates go
p6349
aVis there a warranty?
p6350
aVno there is no warranty associated with it.
p6351
aVoh, that kind of makes me iffy. you want {listing_price} for the phone? right?
p6352
aVyes because its as new as it was when i got it. i can give you for {price} if you will
p6353
aVactually that sounds good. i am willing to pay that amount for this phone.
p6354
ag960
aVgreat then!
p6355

p6356
ag1295
aVhey hows it going?
p6357
aVgood, how old is the {title}
p6358
aVabout 3 years gently used im selling it for a great price of {price}
p6359
aVthat's a bit high for me can you lower the price a tad
p6360
aVhmm i can for you my friend. {price} is as low as i can go.
p6361
aVi have {price} and i can come pick it up please work with me i acually needed somthing with higher amps
p6362
aVok, deal

ag960
aS'<accept>'
p6366
aVhey, so i have this {title} for sale. it's treated me great, it's only {listing_price}.
p6367
aVhi. i am interested in your {title}. would you be willing to accept and offer of {price}?
p6368
aVi can't do that, how about {price} and i'll drop it off.
p6369
aVi think that might work for me. can you tell me anything else about the table, any defects?
p6370
aVthe table is scratched all on top, it wobbles, and one of the {title} snapped on me and i had to glue it back on.
p6371
aVthat being the case i don't think i'm interested after all. i'm looking for something that will actually be in pretty good condition and that will be durable. i'm afraid your {title} just isn't a good deal for me.
p6372
aVlook i'll go down to {price} it's really not all that bad.
p6373
aVno, sorry. the snapped leg being glued back on really decided things for me and i'm going to have to decline that offer. too bad.
p6374
aVfinal offer, i'll take the time to nail the leg back into the table.
p6375
aVi'm sorry a final offer of what, the {partner_price}?
p6376
ag1316
aVno, the best i could do with the condition of the {title} is {price}.
p6377
aVdeal.

aS'<accept>'
p6380
aVhello are you there?
p6381
aVyes, i am here to discuss with you the room?
p6382
aVyes, the room seems adequate for my needs but the payment seems much too high. i want to shoot you another offer, i'm thinking {price} is more than reasonable.
p6383
aVwell i see it's near {title}, but i was wondering exactly how close it is to say restaurants around the area and how convenient it would be to travel around?
p6384
aVbeing one mile from west berkley bowl, it should be easy to find food. even if you don't have transporation, there is major bus lines just a few blocks away and should be quite accessable.
p6385
aVah okay i see, well in the case i can understand the price but i am still on a tight budget. i am really looking to spend no more than {price} for the room.
p6386
aVwell i am really trying to stay within {price} dollars and not go much further than that, the room is highly sought after.
p6387
aVi understand, can we settle for somewhere in-between maybe {price}?
p6388

p6401
aVfor this nice {title} that is much to low. right now i'm selling it for {listing_price}.
p6402
aVi wouldn't be able to verify that i'd be paying a fair price considering the company no longer makes it. what would be the least you'd take?
p6403
aVsince this comes with the mattress as well i would think about going down to about {price}
p6404
aVwhat if you sell just the {title}?
p6405
aVat this time i am selling them as a package deal.

p6427
aVare you totally firm on the price?
p6428
aVthere is always room for negotiation, but i'd not go too low as i really do like the {title}.

aVthe technology is outdated i would pay you {price}
p6450

p6475
aVyeah, where are you located, could i get a lower price if i pick it up?
p6476
aVif you can pick it up, i would be willing to sell the phone for {price}.
p6477
aVmy budget for a used phone is much lower than that ...
p6478
aVthis phone was used very sparingly for only a couple of months, and even comes with a designer case and tempered glass screen. i think you would have a hard time finding an iphone in this condition for a better price. i can ship it to you, for {price}, and will warranty the phone for 6 months. is that acceptable?
p6479
aVi can only do {price} unless something really great is added to the deal ...

aVwhat are campy record parts? is that the brand of the parts?
p6500
aVwell, let me tell you, campy means campagnolo, but as you're interested in this fine bicycle i'm sure you're already familiar with that.
p6501
aVah, yes i am a fine connasuer of bikes! i notice that the wheel size for this {title} is difficult to come by these days and also that brakes tend to wear over time, even when not in use. so i am prepared to offer you {price} for the bicycle. how does that sound?
p6502
aVoh, friend, this is a fine machine, i couldn't take only {partner_price} for it. it's a steal at {listing_price}!
p6503
aVsince it's in {title} condition, how about {price}? it will take me quite a while to find fresh treads for these wheels!
p6504
aVwell, we're getting closer, but i'm afraid {partner_price} is still too low. would you be willing to come pick the {title} up?
p6505
aVyes, i can drive to you and pick it up myself.
p6506
aVokay, if you're willing to come pick the {title} up tonight, i'd be willing to let it go for {price}. i'm afraid that's my best price.

aVare utilities included in the monthly rent?
p6516
aVyes water and garbage are both included in the lease but you need to handle the electrical bills.
p6517
aVthat's a bummer. {listing_price} sounds a little to high ecspcailly since electricty isn't included
p6518
aVwhat's the lowest you and your friend could pay monthly? maybe we can make something work.
p6519
aVah the lowest we can pay is probably around {price} a month.
p6520
aVboth of you would be willing to sign a 1 year lease?
p6521
aVyes!! we are actually pretty desperate for a new apartment rite now so we are willing to sign one asap.
p6522
aVok so here's what i can do, i can do {price} a month but that's the lowest the apartment managet will allow me to offer.

p6539
aVi know {title} is world renown for its top notch acoustics. i'll give you {price} for it.
p6540
aVi'm sorry, that's far too low. since you know {title}'s reputation for quality, you know it's worth more than that.
p6541
aVokay true. {title} is worth {price} when i consider their high quality documentation. if that doesn't work for you please submit a counter offer.

p6548
aVwell, i have chronic migraines and one of my triggers is any smell, so i'm afraid my interest has just plummeted:(
p6549
aVdid i say drakkar noir? i meant homeopathic alpine water that's been chanted over by monks for at least eight years. {price}?
p6550
aVi'm sorry, i find homeopathy and any other pseudoscience to be profoundly upsetting as well. i'd be willing to go as high as {price}.

p6570
aVis it in good condition? i see it has been stored for 27 years, but being stored improperly can damage a {title}.
p6571
aVactually i had it wrapped with plastic wrap and blankets for all the this time and not a single part of rust on it, it looks brand new
p6572
aVthat sounds great! i really want to buy this {title}, but i don't think i can afford the full price. any chance you can lower it a bit for me? i will give you homemade cookies in exchange.
p6573
aVi like the way you're thinking, i do like cookies, i can take off {price} off the price since your nice, but you have to come and get or you have to pay for the delivery charge, ok?
p6574
aVi can come and get it. i can make the deal if you lower it {price}. you can pick the type of cookies i make.:)
p6575
aVi tell you what, we can make it {price} less and we have a deal and don't forget the cookies

p6605
aVwhat is the {title} made of? and can you possible go lower
p6606
aVit's made of solid wood. the mattress also comes with it. the asking price is {listing_price}, and i think that is already pretty fair.
p6607
aVdoes that price include delivery and set up?
p6608
aVno, i would expect that you would pick it up.
p6609
aVi see, well considering i have to hire someone to help me and rent a truck to transport this item, i think {price} is reasonable
p6610
aVi can't go that low. i'd be willing to go as low as {price} if you are the one to come get it.
p6611

aVi could come down a little. what about {price}?
p6676
aVhow about the {price}? the odometer is pretty high.
p6677
aVthe engine only has 15,000 miles on it, it was just put in last year. the lowest i can go is probably {price}.

p6683
aVi know you havn't had the pleasure yet.... but its like sleeping on a cloud! seriously. lol only reason im selling this item is the mrs just accepted a position in japan so we are shedding all our furniture unfortunately ...... it was tempting to stay state side just to keep sleeping on the cloud plus our other items.:)
p6684
aVwell now im sure ill love it. would you be willing to knock down the price? i work at american airlines cand could get you a discount or even more.
p6685

p6692
aVhow are the local schools and the neighborhood ...
p6693

p6694
aVpets are not preferred but with an extra pet deposit i think we can come to an agreement.
p6695
aVgreat, but the price is a little high for me do you think we can come to some sort of arrangement would you possibly take {price} a month?
p6696
aVthe highest i could possibly go is {price}+ deposit would that be ok with you?
p6697
aVthe only way that works is if you take utilities in your name. the total would then be {price} with the pet deposit included.
p6698
aVi can do that:)

p6707
aVbut this one is {title} and comes with a warranty. {price}.
p6708
aVi understand ... how much would you drop from that price if i pick up the item myself. you said you would drop it off, but you didn't realize that i am about 800 miles away

aVthat was a typo. my bad! i meant 90000
p6744
aVhaha, no problem. what kind of wear and tear does it have?

aVhow old are the tires?

p6748
aVand the breaks?
p6749
aValso just replaced this march.
p6750
aV{title}'s with 90k miles in great condition usually sell for around {price}, so that's my offer
p6751
aValright, well that's quite a bit lower than what i'd hoped for. is there any chance you would settle on {price}?
p6752
aVi'll split the difference with you and pay {price} since you have newer breaks and tires
p6753
aVokay that sounds alright with me.
p6754
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p6755

p6775
aVi see. well i'd be happy to give you {price} for it, the dealer would buy it back at lower than that
p6776
aVthis was a second vehicle so the millage is really low! we had it for when the grand kids came from out of town.
p6777
aVi see, so about how much mileage?
p6778
aVthis car only has 21,000 miles! it is fully loaded! you won't find another used car in this pristine condition.
p6779
aVwell my first car was used from a relative under similar conditions, so it's not that rare, but my budget's around {price} does this work for you?
p6780
aVhonestly, i am pretty firm at {listing_price} but i would consider going down to {price} for the right buyer!
p6781
aVit does have some amenities and it is low on mileage, i'll give you that, meet me in the middle at {price} that's already above my budget.
p6782

aVhi! what price are you asking for the bike?
p6999
aVwas hoping for {price} but that's just so i don't have to drive it around
p7000
aVif it is in good condition, i'll come pick it up for {price} so you can get it out of your hair.
p7001
aVthat sounds great, bike is in good condition so you should have plenty of fun with it
p7002

aS'<accept>'
p7004
aVhello, i am interested in the apartment you have for rent
p7005
aV{title}, what can i tell you about it
p7006
aVdo you have any flexibility on your pet policy?
p7007
aVi don't really mind all pets, if it is a cat or a small dog that is quiet i usually will let you have it there but there is an additional fee of {price} per month.
p7008
aVokay thank you. i do not have any pets but it's a good option to have in the future. the price is a little high for my budget at the moment. would you be willing to lower the price if i pay water utilities?
p7009
aVthe utilities are included so no need to do that. i could lower the price to {price} a month and just charge you one month security instead of a month and a half if that helps.
p7010
aVmy budget really allows for around {price} right now.
p7011
aVthat is really low for me to accept, the lowest i could go is {price} i could divide the security deposit over several months so you would not have to pay it all at one time before moving in.
p7012
aVokay i appreciate the flexibility. let's do that. where do we start?
p7013
aVi will send you an offer, {title}!
p7014
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7015
aVhi! how much are you asking for on your {title}?
p7016
aV{listing_price} and it is all yours
p7017
aVsince it's an older model( generations old), can you go {price}? i just want a phone for my daughter to take on school trips and such.
p7018
aVcan you do at least {price} iphones are originally not cheap when they first come out but this will handle all your daughters needs.they are top line pieces of work.
p7019
aVi'll pay {price} and send a courier to collect it so that we don't have to deal with postage.
p7020
aV{price} and i will take it to you.
p7021
aVthat seems reasonable.
p7022

p7023
aVhello there
p7024
aVhi. i am inquiring about the apartment.
p7025
aVit is a beautiful and well maintained. it is close to shops and restaurant. and we have limited time offer for this month. your first month will be free and we waive your application fees
p7026
aVare you able to include any utilities in the price?
p7027
aVif you go with the full price, i can get you cable and waive the water bill as well
p7028
aVi think that is a good deal.
p7029
aVit is. do we have a deal?
p7030
ag960
aVyes we have a deal.
p7031
aS'<accept>'
p7032
ag1905
aVhey there!
p7033
aVcan you tell me some details? curious as to your pet policy
p7034
aVno pets preferred but you can pay a deposit to have one at the property.
p7035
aVeven for a goldfish?
p7036
aVim sure a goldfish would be fine, as it won't damage thee property like a cat or dog.
p7037
aVlol, very true! what is the parking situation?
p7038
aVit doesn't clarify, but parking lot garage same as any other loft
p7039
aVbut is that extra or included?
p7040
ag1914
aVwould you accept {price}?
p7041
aVi could do {price} how does that work for you?
p7042
aVcan you do {price}?
p7043
aVhow about {price} that's a good middle ground. can't really go much lower
p7044
aVfair enough.
p7045
ag960
aVyay!!
p7046
aS'<accept>'
p7047
aVhi there
p7048
aVhello.
p7049
aVare you interested in my car?
p7050
aVyes, can you tell me the accident history?
p7051
aVit is all clear of any accidents. really well maintained as well.
p7052
aVwhat's the mileage?
p7053
ag1926
aVhas there been any other owners?
p7054
aVnope just me, no accidents, well maintained, oil changes not too long ago.
p7055
aVi'd like to come down a little on the price. any wiggle room?
p7056
aVyes i can work with you a little on the price.
p7057
aVwhat about {price} and you pay for tune-up?
p7058
aVwhile you were gone ... i had another offer of {price} i want to get rid of this quickly. can you beat or match that?
p7059
aVsorry. got ta stay closer to {price}. i can pay cash though.
p7060
aVif you can come pick it up with cash today, i will do that.
p7061
aV{my_price} for the car and tune-up?
p7062
aVokay if you have cash today
p7063
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7064
aVhello!
p7065
aVhello, are you interested in making a deal?
p7066
aVi'm totally interested!
p7067
aVokay, its in great shape, did you have any questions?
p7068
aVwhat exactly is the model?
p7069
aVit is a tarmac pro racing bike. has 11 speeds. its only 15lb so easy to move around
p7070
aVokay! forgive me, but i was looking at other information. what is your bottom line?
p7071
aVi can take 2200 for it
p7072
aVoh wow, that is a little out of my league. can we get anywhere near the {price} mark?
p7073
aVsounds fine to me, {partner_price} it is
p7074
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7075
aVhello i am interested in the apartment. are utilities included?
p7076
aVwater and garbage is. you will be responsible for electric and phone internet.
p7077
aVdoes it have new appliances?
p7078
aVit has newer appliances. they match the excellent quality carpeting and paint. just installed last year.
p7079
aVsince it is in the {title} is there flexibility in the price? i would like to pay around {price}
p7080
aVthis is an up and coming {title}, not what you see on tv. i would be willing to go {price} month
p7081
aVi have children and i will need to pay extra to protect them( security system, etc). therefore i would like to pay {my_price}. however i am willing to pay {price}
p7082
aVif you could go to {price}, we have a deal.
p7083
aVokay that works for me
p7084
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7085
aVhello, is the apartment still available?
p7086
aVis your credit good? i'm sorry but i can only rent to people with good credit.
p7087
aVyes my credit is fabulous
p7088
aVgreaat! let's make a deal then. the apartment is available and within walking distance to parks, schools, bus stops. new carpet, haardwood floors, high ceilings. large front and back yard. do you have any questions?
p7089
aVyes. is it pet friendly?
p7090
aVyes, what kind of pet are you thinking of?
p7091
aVi have a 60 lb german shepherd
p7092
aVwow big dog! well, we will need to add a pet deposit of {price}. a one time fee
p7093
aVokay that is fine. are you flexible on the price? i have a large family and {listing_price} is not in my budget. we were looking for somewhere around {price}.
p7094
aVi am flexible. can we negotiate to {price}?
p7095
aVokay. but we don't take section 8 vouchers.
p7096
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7097
aVi am very interested place you have for rent. is it in a good, quiet community?
p7098
aVthis is one of the best communities around. it is also very quiet. not too many people around.
p7099
aVi like everything about it. is there any room on the monthly price?
p7100
aVas long as you can pay the deposit, and sign the 3 month lease there is some room to go down on the price
p7101
aVhow about this. i would willing to sign a longer lease, say 6 months, if we could get the price down to say {price} month.
p7102
aV6 months for {partner_price} a month works for me!
p7103
aValright, sounds like we have a deal.
p7104
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7105
aVis this listing for an apartment or the house?
p7106
aVthis listing is for a {title}.
p7107
aVoh, i'm sorry, i didn't read that at first. is it close to town or shopping? like grocery stores or school?
p7108
aVyes, it is very close to a local strip mall, within walking distance. there is a whole foods and a chick fil a so this is a very hot location.
p7109
aVoh, i love whole foods! does it come with any amenities like washer dryer, dishwasher?
p7110
aVyes, it has a dishwasher and you will have your own personal washer dryer. samsung appliances, brand new last year.
p7111
aVthat sounds fantastic! i am very interested but i just can't comfortably afford {listing_price}. would you take {price}?.
p7112
aVi am willing to negotiate on the price a little. i could drop the price down significantly if you are willing to forgo the parking spot
p7113
aVthat's a pretty big loss ... is there street parking?
p7114
aVyes there is, however parking is a hot commodity so that space is worth a significant discount. i would still let you store a bicycle in the garage. you could fit a grocery bag in the basket of your bike.
p7115
aVi probably should walk more anyway ... alright, what would you be willing to let me rent it for without the parking spot?
p7116
aV{price} without the spot. that should be within your budget?
p7117
aVyes! thank you, new landlord!
p7118
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7119
aVhello, is that a stock photo or the actual car
p7120
aVwell, since you're selling it, i'd hope you'd know!
p7121
aVlol ... yep. that's the actual car. it looks good doesn't it?
p7122
aVi suppose, is there anything wrong with it?
p7123
aVnothing is wrong with it. it's in perfect condition and everything including the a c works. i'm looking for {price} for it
p7124
aVi don't know, how many miles are on it?
p7125
aV80,000 which is really great considering how old the car is
p7126
aVwell, an 8 year old car with 80,000 miles on it? i'd like to pay {price}.
p7127
aVthat's unacceptable. this car is in great condition. i can go for {price}
p7128
aVif you're willing to come down to {price}, i'll come pick it up today.
p7129
aVok, but i need cash.
p7130
ag960
aVokay, i hope sweaty singles are okay, i work as a male stripper:(
p7131
aS'<accept>'
p7132
aVi love the {title}! how long have you had it?
p7133
aVi bought it in march of last year, so a bit longer than one year.
p7134
aVi love the color of it, as well. i saw something like this in another store and it was around {listing_price} new ... is there a way we can get that price a little lower?
p7135
aVi am willing to negotiate, sure. what price did you have in mind?
p7136
aVgiven the year of usage and my personal budget, i would feel comfortable at {price}. i have friends with a truck. so, you won't have to lift a finger.
p7137
aV{partner_price} is lower than i would feel comfortable letting it go for. it is not very old at all, and it really is in almost like new condition, seens a fairly little amount of use. i would be willing to meet you in the middle- how does {price} sound?
p7138
aVlittle to no use? that's a plus! could we meet at the `` new'' middle of {price}? i really need another {title} ...
p7139
aV{price} is the best i can do. that really is more than fair i believe.
p7140
aVi think i could live with {partner_price}. it's a deal!
p7141
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7142
aVnice bike you got there. but it's a bit pricey. how about i pay you {price} and i come and take it off your hand?
p7143
aVi'm willing to negotiate but this ia {title} bicycle. it's worth the money. i can not go as low as {partner_price} if you're willing to pick up the bike, i can go down to {price}.
p7144
aVi can definitely come and pick it up. how about we do {price}? we have a deal then
p7145
aVi'll do {partner_price} you have a deal
p7146
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7147
ag2011
aVhi, how did you acquire this item
p7148
aVi got it in one of those storage auctions
p7149
aVcool. that was a good find. it looks well used. have you tested it to make sure it works?
p7150
aVyes, i plugged it in, it seems to be in full working order
p7151
aVgreat. i'm strapped for cash so would you accept {price} for it?
p7152
aVi don't know. if i'm honest i'm strapped for cash myself( my wife says i need to stop bidding on storage container auctions, but they're just so damn exciting). how about {price}?
p7153
aVthat sounds good. i'll take it.
p7154
aVgreat! thanks!
p7155
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7156
aVgood evening!
p7157
aVhi, i am interested in your {title}. will you take {price} for it? i want it for my daughter.
p7158
aVthat's nice. i was wondering how much it would cost to get it tuned. do you think you can do {price}? i need to borrow a truck and get some help to load it.
p7159
aVif we can leave the deal at {my_price}, you can borrow my truck and i will make sure to have four of my friends here to help you load it.
p7160
aVi think that's a deal. can i come look at it first though?
p7161
aVof course, i wouldn't expect you to buy it without seeing it first.
p7162
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7163
aVhello. are you interested in the {title}?
p7164
aVhello, i am interested in your {title}. would you be willing to take {price}?
p7165
aVthese are brand new in the original package. i can not let them go for less than {price}.
p7166
aVi only have {price} cash, would that be okay?
p7167
aVcash works for me. you have a deal.
p7168
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7169
aVhi so i have a great closet {title} for just under {price}. do you have any questions?
p7170
aVare you the original owner? is this the actual picture of your item? are there any dings, dents, chips in paint? thanks for initiating convo!
p7171
aVyes, i am the only owner. it was well taken care of. the item of the photo is indeed mine. there's no chips, dents or dings. you have to pick it up.
p7172
aVokay. is this heavy? will you be available to help load?
p7173
aVno, my backs bad, you have to lift it yourself. please have cash when you get here. my little niece can help you get it in your vehicle.
p7174
aVi can't go {listing_price}. can you do {price}, since i am meeting you and loading myself?
p7175
aVabsolutely not, this is a designer closet rack. the lowest i could go is {price}.
p7176
aV{title} sounds like ikea to me. i would hardly call it designer. {price}
p7177
aVmeet me in the middle at {price} and you have to disassemble it.
p7178
aVit needs to disassembled before i get there. if i have to disassemble, i must go back and insist on {price}
p7179
aVit's not worth my time to disassemble it for {price}. you can do it when you get here.
p7180
aVthen i need a deeper discount. disassembling is part of your job as the owner, especially if you want this gone.
p7181
aVyou just said you'd do {price}.
p7182
aVi am sorry, i misread that. i will take it for {price}, i pack up and disassemble. we have a deal?
p7183
ag960
aVi don't know, is there anything else you can do for me?
p7184
aVi am disassembling and picking up, plus giving you {my_price}. i think that is a hell of deal on your part
p7185
aVsince i
p7186
aS'<accept>'
p7187
aVhi. would you like to buy my phone package here?
p7188
aVi love the {title} iphone, however, what parts are missing from the box? i like to have everything there if i am going to be paying retail
p7189
aVnone of the parts are missing. most haven't even been used.
p7190
aVoh, gotcha, i misread the statement. would you consider negotiating the price? i love the phone, but not the price, hahahaha
p7191
aVi would be able to part with it for {price}.
p7192
aVhow about {price} and i will pick up? i have cash in hand, ready to go into your hand
p7193
aVthat sounds fair. deal.
p7194
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7195
aVhey, you have a nice {title} here in fremont ca?
p7196
aVyes i do!! do you have any questions about it?
p7197
aVthe {title} downstairs, is that just a toilet vanity?
p7198
aVthat is correct yes, upstairs has a full {title} with shower, tub, toilet vanity ... downstairs just toilet and vanity
p7199
aVand is that a hard stance on no pets? just been shopping round and this place does look really nice ...
p7200
aVi can allow small pets, but would rather not have larger dogs as i've had bad experiences with damage
p7201
aVoh, that's totally fine. i appreciate you making a concession. does {price} sound good? we have no credit issues etc. so the transaction would be pretty easy.
p7202
aVi think we can make that work. thank you
p7203
ag960
aVthank you too.
p7204
aS'<accept>'
p7205
aVhi interested in premium living?
p7206
aVwho isn't? yes, i am.
p7207
aVthen come on down to our community at only {listing_price} a month you could be living your life in luxury, peace and tranquility.
p7208
aVi'm assuming that for a two bedroom arrangement, and i'm planning to be single for quite a while. any {title} you have a one bedroom apartment for sale? i was hoping to only pay a {price} month.
p7209
aVthat is kind of a stretch but tell you what for you i can do {price} a month with a free brochure on all our ammenities
p7210
aVwhat a bargain. i've got a better one for you. i'll do some work around the complex for you in exchange for cheaper rent. how's 10-20 hours labor a month and i'll pay {price} in cash every month for rent.
p7211
aVhmm any special skills?
p7212

aS'<accept>'
p7234
aVhi, what type of finish is the pressedboard on the table?
p7235
aVwell, it's particle board with an ash veneer, like most light {title} desks.
p7236
aVok, and the height is what? by {title} i'm assuming it can be made shorter? i'm looking for an arts& crafts table for my grandkids.
p7237
aVoh i see. would you be willing to accept {price} if i pick it up tonight?
p7238
aVi think that's a little lean. if you are willing to pick it up, i'd be willing to sell it for {price}
p7239
aVthe best i can do is {price} i'm in a budget crunch but i'd really like to have this table.
p7240
aVwell, i'll tell you what, come up to {listing_price}, and i'll throw in the swivel chair in the photo too.
p7241
aVcan you do {partner_price}?
p7242
aVa {title} and a chair for only {my_price}? well, i guess, if you're willing to pick it up tonight.
p7243
aVabsolutely! i can be there in 30 mins.
p7244
aVokay, great, i'll put on some clothes?
p7245
aVok
p7246
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7247
aVhello! how are you? are you interested in this {title} chair?
p7248
aVyes, but i need more information than what you've posted. please tell me about the chair ...
p7249
aVwhat would you like to know?
p7250
aVare they comfortable?
p7251
aVoh yes, very comfortable! the seat is soft yet firm. the back has great support!
p7252
aValright. well, i'm gonna throw out an offer of {price}
p7253
aVwould you be able to go to {price}?
p7254
aVi could do that
p7255
ag960
aVyou have a deal!
p7256
aS'<accept>'
p7257
aVhi!
p7258
aVhi. make an offer. if it's reasonable this car goes with you
p7259
aVwell i am not going to make an offer without some details!
p7260
aVthat's fair. what do you need to know?
p7261
aVhas the car gone through a documented inspection? does it come with an accident damages report?
p7262
aVnothing like that, but it has no problems whatsoever. if you want, i can go smog it for you and it will pass no problems. and those rims and tires are over {price} bucks. the mods on this car is off the hook.
p7263
aVok. sounds reasonable, but you need to make sure in the future that your cars goes through this process if you want to sell them. i will do {price} since this car lacks the requirements for sale.
p7264
aVum inspection is not an requirement in california. all we have to do is the smog. and there is no way i can sell this car for less than {price} it has soem sentimental values because it belonged to my son who's in the marines now. you know.
p7265
aVi understand but i can not risk buying a car that has internal damage. that is a liability to me and i will end up spending thousands in repairs. i will do {price}
p7266
aVthe airbag light is probably the recall issue. the dealer will fix it for free. or i can get it fixed. and if you can't do {price}, we really can't do a deal here.
p7267
aVif you are able to get the airbag fixed i will go up to {price}, you probably wont get better than that from anyone my friend.
p7268
aVyeah no deal then. good luck
p7269
aVpoor guy.
p7270
aS'<quit>'
p7271
aVhi, that's a nice {title} you have there.
p7272
aVi do need one but i see that i would have to paint it so that's work for me. does it have any other defects?
p7273
aVno other defects other than needing a good rinse and coat of nice paint. if you want i'll do it for you. it will take a couple of days to fully dry and smell free, but that's doable.
p7274
aVthat would be good of you but only if you have the time and supplies. would you be willing to accept {price} for it. i'll even pick it up.
p7275
aVi do have the time and the supplies. but i can't do any lower than {price} for this. at {listing_price} i'm already giving it away, practically
p7276
aVi appreciate the effort you are willing to put into it but i'm poor. how about {price}?
p7277

p7284
aVthe parts are all intact and no, it doesn't need tlc
p7285
aVwould you be willing to take {price} dollars for it if i picked it up
p7286
aVi could give it for {price}
p7287

aVhi i am interested in the house you just posted.
p7293
aVhello. sure thing please let me know if you have any questions?
p7294
aVi see its been remodeled. can you tell me what has been upgraded?
p7295
aVthe floor has been remodeled as well as the bathrooms
p7296
aVonly {title} bathroom, correct? the houses i've been looking at in this area have at least 1.5 bathrooms and they are on the market for around {price}
p7297
aVthe location is convenient. is that a {price} car garage or does the other garage belong to another house?
p7298
aVno its {price} car garage
p7299
aVi can do {price}. can i install indoor outdoor security cameras from my current {title}?
p7300
aVyes absolutely!
p7301

p7303
aVhello. i really liked this {title} highlander. have been looking for it for a long time now, and this is something that caught my attention
p7304
aVyeah, it's a wonderful vehicle, very spacious and extremely reliable. as you can see it's recently gotten a brand new engine and that's why i'm asking {listing_price}.
p7305
aVyeah but its very expensive for me. i am a student and can't afford this much. would you be willing to sell it for me at about {price}?
p7306
aVokay i can do that. as long as i am assured that this car has never had any major breakdown and that i will be happy with the purchase
p7307
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7308
aVhi i see you have a go pro for sale
p7309
aVyes, it is in great condition.
p7310
aVhow many times have you used it?
p7311
aVoh, i barely used it. i did use the curved adhesive mount so that is the only thing that i don't have. all in all i would say it was used about 3 hours.
p7312
aVoh i see. you only have the flat mount? are there
p7313
aVright, i just have the flat mount but the whole package is in great condition. the 3-way pivot arm is in perfect shape. there is barely any play in the motion but it is smooth and effortless so you get a nice panning action.
p7314
aVthat sounds really good. since i will have to purchase the additional mount, would you accept {price}?
p7315
aVlisten, i'll be honest, the list price is {listing_price} and this thing is in new condition minus the mount. it's true that i have used it though minimally, so i'd be willing to let it go at {price}.
p7316
aVi could do that ... agreed at {price}?
p7317
aVgreat, that's a fair deal. i hope you get lots of use and enjoyment from it. {partner_price}, it's a deal.
p7318
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7319
aVhow we doing today
p7320
aVi am wonderful. how are you?
p7321
aVi m good thanks, so lets get down to it
p7322
aVok. well i see you're in the market for a {title}. i have one in great condition that i'm willing to part with for {listing_price}
p7323
aVi bet it's a little old and needs tuning, how about i offer you {price} dollars
p7324
aVwell it is a few years old and it does need tuning but it has been kept up very well. i think {price} would be better.
p7325
aVok let's do it for {partner_price} but you have to promise me that you will deliver the {title} to my home, fair enough?
p7326
aVit really heavy so you will have to help lift it but i'll go to your place to help unload it. {my_price} works though.
p7327
ag960
aVok nice doing business with you, good day
p7328
aS'<accept>'
p7329
aVwhat conditions are the rubbers?
p7330
aVthey are in pretty decent condition. still got lots of life left. are you interested?
p7331
aVyeah sure i need a bicycle to go to my place of work fromm my room
p7332
aVok, cool. you want to come take a look at it?
p7333
aVok sure but only have {price} dollars in this moment
p7334
aVsorry, i can't go that low. it is a {title} bike after all and in great condition. i can do {price} though.
p7335
aVyes good i can get the {price} dollars in the afternoon
p7336
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7337
aVhello are you interested in this car?
p7338
aVhello, i'm interested.
p7339
aVok well its a 08 {title}, great shape, runs good. one owner.
p7340
aVare there any problems with the car?
p7341
aVa airbag light stays on but the car runs great.
p7342
aVokay, well, i'm interested. i'd like to pay {price}
p7343
aVthat is kind of low, i just poured 2k into this car to get new tires.
p7344
aVwell, it's still a 9 year old car.
p7345
aVi will offer you {price} and i will throw in a warranty for you so if anything goes wrong it will be covered.
p7346
aVif you can come down to {price} i'll come pick the car up.
p7347
aVwill you go to {price} and ill throw in free tinted windows?
p7348
aVthat sounds reasonable.
p7349
ag960
aVokay, great.
p7350
aS'<accept>'
p7351
aVhello! i understand you are interested in the property i'm selling?
p7352
aVyes, i am interested. how long has this house been on the market.
p7353
aVthe apartment has been on the market for about 2 weeks.
p7354
aVi like the details on the house and it seems nice. how is the neighborhood? how are the apartment neighbors?
p7355
aVgreat neighborhood! very close to shops, franklin park, and public transport.
p7356
aVsounds great the price seems pretty steep, if you do not mind may you please accept my offer of {price}.
p7357
aVi think {partner_price} is a bit low but could meet in the middle at {price}.
p7358
ag960
aVdoes it come with any perks? is there any gyms on site. does the apartment complex come with a pool?
p7359
aVokay.
p7360
aS'<reject>'
p7361
aVhello, are you interested in a beautiful {title} to purchase?
p7362
aVi am interested. would you be able to deliver?
p7363
aVpotentially, i could do that.
p7364
aVhow old is the set?
p7365
aVit actually is fairly new. it's 2 years old.
p7366
aVi am interested although the limit i had set for myself was {price}. would you consider taking a bit less than what you are asking?
p7367
ag960
aVi can do that. thank you!
p7368
aS'<accept>'
p7369
aVhello i am interested in your buying your {title}
p7370
aVsure, it is still available. would you like to come take a look?
p7371
aVyes sure you can you tell me more about it?
p7372
aVit's in great condition. we had it in our guest bedroom, so it's hardly used. we are turning the room into nursery, that's why we are selling it.
p7373
aVi see. i would like to offer {price} and i will come and pick it up.
p7374
aVok i can do {price} that seems fair. i can come over later today to pick it up.
p7375
aVawesome.
p7376
aVok i can do {my_price} that seems fair. i can come over later today to pick it up.
p7377
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7378
aVhello, i'm interested in the {title} ... are you certain you will be able to transfer the warranty to me?
p7379
ag2216
aVgreat. can you tell me the dimensions of the {title}? i want to make sure it will hold my larger items
p7380
aVsorry i dont have that
p7381
ag960
aS'<quit>'
p7382
aVgood morning
p7383
aVmorning.
p7384
aVhow can i help you?
p7385
aVi see that you have this {title} for sale. how many people can it ft?
p7386
aVi've been able to get 10-12 around it with ease
p7387
aVoh that sounds great. can i offer {price} because of the crack?
p7388
aVhmmm ... where are you located? i'd be willing to drop the price to {price} and deliver it to you if you are reasonably close by.
p7389
aVwith delivery i'd give you the {partner_price} i'm on the outskirts of the city.
p7390
aVok, that's plenty close. let's do the {my_price} with the included delivery. i think you'll really enjoy this {title}!
p7391
aVgreat, i think i'll enjoy it as well. i'll email my address. thanks so much!
p7392
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7393
aVhey! i am very interested in the {title}. would you say it is more on the firm or soft side?
p7394
aVhey there, thanks for contacting me. i'd say it's more on the soft side. it has a {title} pillow top.
p7395
aVawesome, i definitely prefer soft. does it come with any sort of warranty?
p7396
aVi did originally purchase it with a warranty. it was a 5 year warranty, so there's a year and a half left.
p7397
aVmakes sense. does this include a boxspring as well?
p7398
aVoh yes. the boxspring is free.
p7399
aVwhat a deal! if i were to pick it up, would you be willing to take {price}?
p7400
aVhow about {price} because of the added warranty?
p7401
aVthat sounds good to me! {partner_price} it is.
p7402
ag960
aVgreat. contact me at 345-7878 when you're ready to pick it up.
p7403
aS'<accept>'
p7404
aVhi there, i was looking at your ad for the {title} you listed, about how old is it?
p7405
aVit is about 3 years old, but is in excellent condition. it has no stains or rips.
p7406
aVi was thinking about buying it for my nana, you know how old couches get a little soft and hard to get out of. are you sure you couldn't deliver? it would be a little difficult for me to pay so much and still have to pick it up, i mean, it's a 3 year old {title}.
p7407
aVi can not deliver, but i can give it to you for {price} if you pick it up.
p7408
aVthat sounds reasonable.
p7409
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7410
aVhey so i'm interested in the closet rack, can you tell me about it?
p7411
aVsure! it's very sturdy and does not need to be attached to the wall as it has {title} feet. it's 10feet wide with 12'' and 16'' deep shelves. all together it's 83'' tall
p7412
aVhow's the condition, is it nice?
p7413
aVyes, it's in excellent condition, no rust or bending anywhere. perfect for a library!
p7414
aVis it already disassembled, or do i have to do that?
p7415
aVit's assembled and will fit in most pickup trucks, but if you need to dissasemble it, it's super easy to put back together.
p7416
aVok, but i'm looking to pay more towards {price} if i have to pick it up and do all of that myself. it looks huge.
p7417
aVthat's a little too low ... can we do {price} and i'll help you move it?
p7418
aVi think you'd need to do most of the work for that price, you could consider the extra {price} a delivery fee.
p7419
aVyou have a really good point there. alright, i'll do {partner_price}
p7420
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7421
aVgood morning
p7422
aVhey there! what condition are the shelves in?
p7423
aVthey are in very good condition. i have used them in my food cellar for storage and they are nearly perfect.
p7424
aVwhat color are they? i can't really tell from the photo.
p7425
aVthey're kind of a dark gray ... along the lines of a slate. think of the color of a blackboard.
p7426
aVmakes sense. can they hold a lot of weight?
p7427
aVthe shelves are very stable. when i bought them, the packaging indicated that each shelve could hold up to 250 pounds.
p7428
aVexcellent. if i picked them up, would you be willing to let them go for {price}?
p7429
aVtell you what, for {partner_price}, i will deliver them to you. how about that?
p7430
ag960
aVwhat a deal! sounds good.
p7431
aS'<accept>'
p7432
aVhey! do you still have the couch available?
p7433
aVhello, yes i do.
p7434
aVit appears to be in pretty good condition from the photos but i'm not sure that i could come pick it up. i may have to rent a truck. would {price} sound good to you? i can provide cash.
p7435
aVit is in very good condition and is very comfortable. i do not think i can go that low. i will however throw in a warranty at {price}
p7436
aVif the warranty will cover any damage that may occur during transit, i can do {partner_price}
p7437
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7438
aVhi, do you still have the {title} in stock?
p7439
aVyes i do, a nice little car that is also envronmentally sound. i am moving so i need to get ri of it so just looking for an easy sale to benefit us both
p7440
aVah great- a few questions? have any pipe smokers driven the car or has it been in any accidents?
p7441
aVi am the only driver and i don't smoke and tend to be quite boring so it is cldan and ready to go.
p7442
aVgreat how flexible are you on the price?
p7443
aVwhat if i paid with a bag full of cash? would that change the price?
p7444
aS'{price}'
p7445
aVi think i could do {price}
p7446
aVyou might but i cant go lower than {price}
p7447
aVhow about {price} and i will throw in a free car wash
p7448
ag960
aV{partner_price} dollars? ok then
p7449
aS'<accept>'
p7450
ag960
aVhello do you still have the {title}?
p7451
aVyes i do, are you interested?
p7452
aVyes i am. what kinda condition is it in?
p7453
aVits in excellent condition. we had it in our sitting room that never got used.
p7454
aVokay. are you willing to work with me on the price at all?
p7455
aVi'm pretty firm on the {my_price}, what price are you suggesting?
p7456
aV{partner_price}? it's listed at {price}.
p7457
aVmust have been a mistake but i am willing to give you a deal for {partner_price} since it was listed in error.
p7458
aVstill too high. i've seen this {title} sell for {my_price} new so how about {price}
p7459
aVit is still used though. will you do {price}?
p7460
aS'<reject>'
p7461
ag2288
aVhello do you still have the {title} for sale?
p7462
aVyes i do, it's absolutely still for sale
p7463
aVwhat condition is it in? has it been in any accidents?
p7464
aVit's never been in an accident and it's free of any dents or dings ... looks great in person
p7465
aVokay that sounds good. how many miles does it have on it?
p7466
aVit has {price}, 000 miles or so
p7467
aVwow that is a lot of miles for a {title}. can you go lower on the price?
p7468
aVit is a lot of miles but mostly highway. it's kept the engine really clean. i can come down in price. what number were you thinking?
p7469
aVcan you do {price}? since it's such high miles
p7470
aVi couldn't go that low. i'm more around 9500 bottom line
p7471
aVokay how about we meet halfway then, how about {price}?
p7472
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7473
aVthat is a nice {title}
p7474
aVit's really great! i wish i didn't have to get rid of it but i'm moving away soon. i bought the set for {price} last year and for {listing_price} i think it's a steal.
p7475
aVindeed but it is still used and i will have to to get it in my house myseld. {price} dollars?
p7476
aVyeah, that seems fair
p7477
ag960
aVvery well it's a deal
p7478
aS'<accept>'
p7479
aVhey there are you looking to buy my {title}?
p7480
aVpossibly, what kind of {title} mileage does it get?
p7481
aVits definitely a {title}. it has 84k miles and drives handles like new. it packs a punch and is very powerful. such a great car. im asking for around {price}. are you in the ballpark of that offer?
p7482
aVwould you be willing to take {price}? {title} is getting kind of old.
p7483
aVhmm, actually that sounds very reasonable for this car since it is {title}, you're right that is getting pretty old. thanks for your offer, glad we could reach a deal!
p7484
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7485
aVhello there
p7486
aVhi. just saw your ad and i'm very interested in your {title} set!
p7487
aVgreat, it is in great shape but i need the buyer to pick it up, would that be a problem?
p7488
aVhave you had it long? anything wrong with it? stains, scratches, etc.?
p7489
aVnope, no stains or scratches, it is in great shape and it is {title} so it really retains its value. haven't had it too long but i have taken very good care of it.
p7490
aVsounds good. {listing_price} is a bit over my budget, do you think you'd be able to take {price} for it? especially being that i need to haul it myself. i'll probably need to hire some help, so factoring that in to the cost.
p7491
ag960
aVyes sounds great
p7492
aS'<accept>'
p7493
ag2317
aVhi! this is a brand new phone that i got from work, but since i have a phone already, i'm selling this one. are you interested?
p7494
aVyes, i am i need a new phone because my old one broke.
p7495
aVi understand your phone is broken. can you pay {price}, and i will drop off the phone to you?
p7496
aVthe most i can really afford to pay is {price}.
p7497
aVwhat's wrong with your old phone? if the screen is just broken, i can get that fixed. i really feel for you and i want to make a deal. so if you give me your old phone, i can sell you the new phone for {price}. does that work?
p7498
aVi could go as high as {price} the old phone is in good condition it just has a crack in the screen. it is an android and i'd rather have an {title}.
p7499
aVhello. i was hoping to buy your battery for {price}
p7500
aVwell, it is unopened. how about {price} if i come to you?
p7501
aVwe have a deal since this part of my asking price included the shipping cost. thanks!
p7502
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7503
aVhi! this is a great exercise bike with lots of features. i hate to let it go, but i need the cash. are you interested in buying the bike?
p7504
aVyes, i am interested in it. what canyou tell me about it and what price?
p7505
aVit is really an all around fitness bike with lots of bells and whistles. it has plenty of connections to things like heart rate monitors and computers. i need the cash, so i would be willing to sell it for {price}. deal?
p7506
aVno, this is not a good book, i can only pay {price}. my final offer.
p7507
ag960
aVi don't know what you mean when you say `` this is not a good book.'' i can not take {partner_price} for something that is worth almost twice that. sorry, but no deal.
p7508
aS'<reject>'
p7509
aVi'm starting to think nothing will meet their `` acceptance criteria''.
p7510
aVoh, haha. so did you have any problems with this {title} when you used it?
p7511
aVit is unopened, so i did not use it.
p7512
aVoh cool. why are you selling it, did you get another one instead?
p7513
aVi was planning on using it for my phone, but my car has a usb port, so i decided i didn't need it.
p7514
aVwill you take {price} cash today?
p7515
aVi paid {price} for this, so i'm not going any lower than that, sorry.
p7516
aVif you throw in the original receipt, so i can have the warranty details, then we have a deal at {partner_price}.
p7517
aVi do have the receipt, so that'll work. {my_price} it is.
p7518
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7519
aVhi, i saw your post and am interested in it. can you tell me more about it?
p7520
aVsince it's brand new, why are you selling it?
p7521
aVwon it in a contest and i am not an apple user.
p7522
aVok, makes sense. so, i would like to get it, but it's a bit too expensive for me. i would like to offer {price} for it.
p7523
aVcould you do {price}?
p7524
aVyes, i can do that, it's a fair price. sounds great!
p7525
ag960
aVgreat, thanks!
p7526
aS'<accept>'
p7527
aVhi, i really like the bike and description. any way you would consider letting it go for {price}?
p7528
aV{partner_price} is a tad too low, the listing price is {listing_price}. its a really well build bike and will help you achieve your fitness goals easier. would you be willing to pay {price} if i deliver it to your place for free?
p7529
aVi can pay {price} if you deliver and throw in a helmet and lock for the bike. deal?
p7530
aVi can do all of that, but only for {price}. deal?
p7531
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7532
aVi am interested in your device and would like to offer {price} cash for it.
p7533
aVi don't think i could go that low. its unopened and retails at {price}, so i think {listing_price} is a fair offer. i got it as a gift but already have one, trust me they're great and work super well. 6+ hours of battery life extra if you're using a tablet, 9 hours with a small tablet, and 24 hours extra with a smartphone. well worth {listing_price} imo.
p7534
aVi could offer {price}
p7535
aVi can't go lower sorry. its worth {my_price}, so {listing_price} is a deal already. like i said, unopened, never been opened, new. its worth {listing_price} no less. final offer.
p7536
ag960
aVthe most i could pay is {price}. are you willing to give a little? i can pay cash today.
p7537
aVno, i'm sorry. the best i can do is {listing_price} and i can deliver it to your house free of charge. thats the best you'll get from me.
p7538
aVguess we can't make a deal
p7539
aVokay, please reject my offer if you must.
p7540
aS'<reject>'
p7541
aVhi are you interested in my {title}?
p7542
aVyes, mine was stolen so i need a new one, what kind of shape is it in?
p7543
aVit is brand new!
p7544
aVok, well i have {price} in cash to spend does that sound good? i can come to you to pick it up and save you gass
p7545
aV{price} and you have a deal
p7546
aVi really only have {my_price} and i would be saving your the gas and time ... that's worth {price} yeh?
p7547
aVok, well i can buy it brand new for {price} so i will just do that
p7548
ag2364
aS'<quit>'
p7549
aVhi, what are you asking for the {title}
p7550
aVim asking for {listing_price}, they are new and still in the original package.
p7551
aVi see ... well i'm probably the only old guy clinging to my {title} ... can you come down to {price} maybe?
p7552
aVyeah i can do {partner_price}. glad we could make a deal today. thanks a lot, i hope you enjoy your product.
p7553
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7554
aVhi, are these orginal equipment
p7555
aVyes they sure are
p7556
aVi'm probably the only guy in town still using this old {title} ... would you take {price} for them?
p7557
aVhow about {price}
p7558
aVwell i do really need them and they're kind of hard to find ... so i can do {partner_price} if you can

aVhs this truck ever been in an accident?
p7644
aVno, it has never been in an accident. are you interested in buying it for {price}? or do you have a trade in?
p7645
aVno, to high, the truck does not have any additions, it is a plain fleet work truck and most likely doesn't even have power windows.
p7646
aVwhat about your trade in?
p7647
aVi can give you {price} or 2006 honda atv, perfect condition, clean title and new large tires.
p7648

p7657
aVi would like to move in asap. but, would you be willing to lower the price a bit for me?
p7658
aVwell, i can't go too low. what's your budget? i don't think i could go below {price} considering it's a {title}
p7659
aVwould you be willing to lower it to {price}? it would help me out a bit as i am on a budget.

aVhey, so you were thinking about a {title}?
p7669
aVyes, i am very interested.
p7670
aVoh, well that's cool. usually people see me and lowball me, i am obviously a gay surfer.
p7671
aVoh why would they do that? thats not fair
p7672
aVwell, surfers live in their cars in the search for the right wave, so this thing has some wear and tear. but, listen, i have to drive all over the place to get the best wave. so, you know i pay the best mechanics. i don't know anything about mechanical engineering.
p7673
aVoh ok. i understand. that is awesome. you are one lucky guy!
p7674
aVlol! that is very important. i want a car that get me anywhere i need to go. this is a nice car; however, you are asking for too much. you know, it is not a brand new {title}.
p7675
aVlol. come on! the price is still high. i will give you {price} right now for the car. i am ready to take it home with me right at this moment!
p7676
aVha, ok. it is high. but i'm not. how did you come up with {partner_price}? you must be tired. listen, you can sleep in the back. i have many a time. i'll even give you my old yoga mat. ok, ok, {price}, lets do this!
p7677
aVi know that you are not high! well, i am a young broke college student. i was able to save some of my financial aid money in order to buy this very nice car. i really need it. do you know how many times i have to ask people for rides. this is a great opportunity for me to buy a car. i am willing to pay {price}.
p7678
aVhi, so i have an amazing {title} truck for sale. it's very tough and reliable.
p7679
aVwhat is your reason for selling this truck?
p7680
aVmy wife has been yelling at me to get a minivan and i can't afford both insurance payments.
p7681
aVi am interested, but {listing_price} is too high of a price for a 10 year old truck. i have {price} cash in my hand. i could come and pick it up right now and take it off your hands
p7682
aVit only has 173k the price is already low. i can knock {price} off if you can meet me later today.
p7683
aV173k miles on a {title} really is a lot of miles, the most i can offer is {price} cash
p7684
aV{title}'s are built to last! {price} and you have a deal.
p7685
aVat {price} can you include a full tank of gas? i'm ready to head over right now

p7690
aVi have an extra chair i could throw in if our are interested. so the {title} and the chair, you pick it up for {listing_price} total?

p7696
aVhow many miles does it have on it?
p7697
aVonly 56000
p7698
aVwould you consider going a little lower for a {title}, say {price}?
p7699
aVno that is half of my asking price it is from {title} but as i said it is in very good condition and only has 56000 miles on it.
p7700

p7705
aVi could borrow a little more and give you {price} but tha's as high as i can possibly go.

p7739
aVhm, {price}? it does have a lot of miles but she was really good to me. i recently did all the maintenance on it including things like the transmission and oil so that you won't have to worry about that for 100k or more miles

p7744
aVthats too low
p7745
aVwell why should i pay more? it looks busted and old? to be honest, it kinda looks like it rides bad too.
p7746
aVit works great you can be assured of that. nothing below {price}
p7747
aVwell, i can't go above {price} for a piece of junk. send me your offer, i'll probably reject it just like that junky bike.
p7748
ag960

p7758
aVyes i am how old is the {title}
p7759
aVit is a couple years old, very gently used and no scratches on it. the {title} unscrew for easy transport. i am asking {listing_price} for it.
p7760
aVthere doesn't seem to be much to the {title}. it's pretty plain. how about around {price}?
p7761
aVsorry no deal on anything lower, {my_price} is my limit.
p7762
aVi would be willing to go to {price} but that is my highest for the {title}
p7763
aVif you pick it up then {partner_price} would be acceptable.
p7764
aVokay that sounds reasonable. we will do {my_price}.

p7774
aVhey, you still have that bike for sale?
p7775
aVindeed i do. would you like it?
p7776
aVi'm definitely interested. but i'm concerned about the quality. you said in the ad you had to rebuild it?
p7777
aVyeah, it's been through a lot. that's why i'm offering it for so cheap, only {listing_price} bucks
p7778
aVthat's still a bit higher than what i wanted to spend. would you take {price} for it? i'll even come by with a pick up truck and pick it up myself.
p7779
aVhmm, really was hoping for a bit more, but i can go for {price} if you pay in two 20s. easier to get from the atm anyway:)
p7780
aVhaha, okay, i can't argue with that logic. {partner_price} it is.
p7781
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7782
aVhey, nice {title} you got, is it newish?
p7783
aVit looks nice. i have a {title} camera so it will sync and work well with the common software. i'll give you {price} bucks
p7784
aVwell i can do {partner_price} or if you would like, i have {title} paper that goes with it was part of the package too. i can throw that in if you will do {listing_price} the paper alone was {listing_price}
p7785
aV{my_price} for the {title}, sold to the highest bidder
p7786
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7787
aVwhat is the lowest price you would take for the {title}?
p7788
aVi can go down a little bit but not much. it's still in great condition and i barely used it at all.
p7789
aVwould you take {price} if i come and pick it up?
p7790
aVi think {price} would be more fair since i already lowered the price when i listed the {title} again. how's that sound?
p7791
aVthrow in a {title} helmet and we have deal.
p7792
aVsure i can throw in my helmet no problem! we have a deal.

aVyes i just had a couple questions. are pets allowed? and does it come with appliances?
p7798
aVit does come with a washer and dryer in the unit. the stove, fridge and microwave are also included. we do allow outdoor pets.
p7799
aVokay is there any way you can bring the price down?
p7800
aVit is in a very great location, and has new flooring. so i do not want to go too low, i think {price} is reasonable
p7801
aV{price} and its a deal
p7802
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p7803
aVhey do you still have the {title}?
p7804
aVi sure do. i do have quite a bit of interest in it though.
p7805
aVi had some questions about it. what is it made of and what is the condition like?
p7806
aVit is made of oak and chrome with a dark finish. it is about 6.5 feet tall and in perfect condition
p7807
aVi'd really like to have it but my budget is around {price} could you lower the price at all?
p7808
aVthe lowest that i can go right now is {price}, this cost me over 1200 brand new and i have only had it a year. just stuck moving and it won't fit in the new place.
p7809
aVi can do {partner_price} but you have to come get it and just so you know i am in a 2nd story apartment.
p7810
aVthat's fine i can come by and move it myself! thank you!

p7835
aVi can work with you on the price a little bit but within reason. it's a nice place and it's in a good neighborhood as well.
p7836
aVi understand, but i'm on a really tight budget right now. i honestly can afford much more than {price} a month.
p7837
aV{partner_price} is out of the question, are you sure this is in your price range? i can come down to {price}.
p7838
aVwell the place is kind of big. would you be open to letting me sublet? i can probably get 3 other people to rent the place with me so i can stay in budget and still get you {partner_price} a month.
p7839
aVyes that would be possible, so we have a deal at {my_price}?
p7840
aVyea that works.

aVhello, you are here about my {title} posting?
p7843
aVyes i am. would you accept {price} for your phone?
p7844
aVhmm ... {partner_price} seems a little low considering it's condition.
p7845
aVi would be willing to pick it up, and i could pick it up in an hour.
p7846
aVthat sure would make things more convenient. how about i take {price} off of it since you're ready to buy.
p7847
aVlets call it {price} and i'll head over right now. does that work?
p7848
aVthat sounds good to me! i had a case with it but i was going to sell it separately. how about i throw that in as well since we were able to come to such a good deal?
p7849
aVsounds good to me. i'll see you in a bit.
p7850
ag960
aVsee you then!

p7852
aVhi i saw your post and was wondering if you still have the {title} available?
p7853
aVyes it is still available.
p7854
aVcould you tell me a little more about it? how tall is it and what material is it made out of?
p7855
aVsure it's approx. 7 feet tall and it's brown oak drifted color finish.
p7856
aVand is it in pretty good condition?
p7857
aVyes, no damage at all.
p7858
aVi know you are asking {listing_price} for it but i also noticed that you have had this ad up for over a month so i was hoping that you would be willing to take {price} for it? i could come get it right away.
p7859
aVi would be willing to take {price} and i'll help you load it up when you come.
p7860
aVi can do {partner_price} that seems fair enough. thank you very much.
p7861

p7862
aVis the box springs and bed rail included?
p7863
aVyes i will include the boxsprings for free with the {title}
p7864
aVis there anyway you can come down a bit in price? i'm strapped for cash but really need a bed. maybe {price}?
p7865
aVi'm giving you a good offer, lowest i can go is {price}
p7866
aVwell at {partner_price} i can't afford to buy any sheets that would fit the matress. could you throw in a few sheets and i would be wiling to go the {partner_price}
p7867
aVsure that's fine, i'll throw in extra sheets for {my_price}
p7868

aVhello, i was interested in your {title} and would like some more info regarding it
p7876
aVi've never actually used it ...( i did take it out though to make sure everything was there)- i'm asking {listing_price} for it but if you could come get it tonight or tomorrow i can throw in 4 ink cartiridges for free( probably worth around {price})
p7877
aVi was hoping to get if for less than {listing_price} but the ink carts sound pretty good. i can do the {listing_price} if you would be willing to meet me somewhere in between both our locations possibly?
p7878
aVyes, i can do {listing_price} with the ink cart. and can meet at the target

aVhey! im interested in looking at your {title}, could i get a few details before i come out to buy it?
p7881
aVwhat would you like to know?
p7882
aVim glad you have a {title}, but i'm curious, how many miles does the truck have?
p7883
aVi don't honestly know off the top of my head
p7884
aVwell, shoot. what are you asking for it?
p7885
aS'{listing_price}'
p7886
aVshesh, that is a little steep for such an old truck. could i meet you in the {price} range?
p7887
aVthe lowest i could go is {price}. its in good condition.
p7888
aVyou say that, but i can see in the picture that the right blinker is held on with duct tape, let alone the dint in the side. i thought you would jump at such an offer.
p7889
aVit's a good truck. the kbb value is {price}. {my_price} is more than a fair price. i'm selling not giving it away
p7890
aVi was just looking for something to give to my son ... i'm not trying to break the bank. could we agree on {price}?
p7891
aVhow about {price}
p7892
aVhows {price}? thats honestly the best i can do.
p7893
aV{partner_price} and i keep the rack.
p7894
aVdeal.

aS'<accept>'
p7897
aVhi do you still have the {title}?
p7898
aVyes, i sure do.
p7899
aVhow old is the {title} and is it in good condition?
p7900
aVit's very new. i rode it three times and realized it's just too tall for me. love the {title} it's just too tall. it's like new!
p7901
aVhow about selling it to someone who would put it to good use for {price}?
p7902
aS'<quit>'
p7903
aVhi there, i am interested in your rental unit but would like to find out more.
p7904
aVhello, so i take it that you are very interested in buying this newly {title} apartment?
p7905
aVyes, but the price you have listed is quite high.
p7906
aVi think it is a fair price considering how close it is to whole foods, but i am willing to negotiate.
p7907
aVhello, so i take it that you are very interested in buying this newly {title} apartment?
p7908
aVi do like the proximity to whole foods, but the unit doesn't have its own laundry room, i would have to share the on-site one.
p7909
aVok, does {price} sound fair?
p7910
aVi think that's still too high. consider that i'm only getting one bedroom, so i don't even have space for guests.
p7911
aVok, does {my_price} sound fair?
p7912
aVi think it is a fair price considering how close it is to whole foods, but i am willing to negotiate.
p7913
aVwell, it is only 6 miles from san francisco, maybe you can visit friends there. how about {price}?
p7914
aVare you able to offer any other amenities or incentives for that price?
p7915
aVi can throw in free cable tv.
p7916
aVyou make a tempting offer. my budget is pretty tight though, would you be able to knock it down to {price} for that deal?
p7917
aVwell, it is only 6 miles from san francisco, maybe you can visit friends there. how about {my_price}?
p7918
aVsounds like a deal!
p7919
ag960
aVgreat!
p7920
ag2701
aVi can throw in free cable tv.
p7921
aVhi, is your truck still for sale?
p7922
aVyes it is!
p7923
aVhow many miles?
p7924
aVit is actually pretty low mileage, my grandmother only drove it to church on sundays. church wasn't very far, so it only has 15,000 miles on it. such a deal!
p7925
aVpretty cool grandma to be riding in a {title}
p7926
aVyeah, i come from a long line of rabble-rousers! we originally got it for her for her rabbit farm, but she kept bring the bunnies in the house and not selling them. did you need a bunny with the truck?
p7927
aVi don't need a bunny but is your grandma single? how about i take her out for a nice steak dinner and give you {price} for the truck?
p7928
aVsorry, grandma is a vegetarian and she needs more than that. she just received her medical marijuana farming license and there are a lot of start up costs. although, you can become one of her `` special'' customers and get a deal on the new crop. grandma can grow anything.( we are still recovering from the zucchini incident).
p7929
aVwould you accept {price} and i'll give her 100 sensi star clones
p7930
aVas the bunnies multiplied like, well, bunnies, sadly, we don't have quite enough room for the clones. if grandma throws in the medical license, two bunnies( they are trained in the art of self defense and would make excellent body guards( one of the reasons we had difficulty selling them for meat). also, the price the train car and the hydroponic system is quite high. {partner_price} doesn't cover it. oh did i mention that the truck has a hot tub in the back?
p7931
ag2711
aVhi there, i am interested in buying your {title}. how old is it?
p7932
aVit's only 3 months old practically like new. i even have a side table to go wtih it that i'll throw in free
p7933
aVhave the items been around pets? i have some allergies.
p7934
aVpet free, smoke free home
p7935
aVi appreciate your offer but i don't really have space for a table, my unit is pretty small. would you be willing to knock the price of the {title} down to {price} without the table?
p7936
aV{partner_price} is lower than i'd like to go. how about we meet in the middle at {price}?
p7937
aVthat sounds fair!
p7938
aVgreat! thanks!

p7940
aVhello do you still have the {title}?
p7941
aVi do!
p7942
aVnice. okay so is it in good condition? it doesn't look used does it?
p7943
aVit's in excellent condition. one owner household, one person sleeping on it with minimal ware. no stains or discolorations. it's a beautiful {title} pillowtop.
p7944
aVhow old is it?
p7945
aVi purchased it in december of 2013 so about 3.5 yrs.
p7946
aVokay so it is kind of old. would you take {price} for it?
p7947
aVi'll take {price} cash if you pick it up.
p7948
aS'<quit>'
p7949
aVhey there, you were interested in the {title}?
p7950
aVhi. is your car still for sale?
p7951
aVit sure is, were you looking to buy it today?
p7952
aVyes. i can give you {price} cash today.
p7953
aVehh, that is way too low for me. what could i do to get you home in this car for at least {price}?
p7954
aVwill you accept {price}? that's stretching it for me. the car is almost 10 years old.
p7955
aVnearly 10 years yes, but the car only has 10,000 miles, there isnt a scratch on it. with the ammount of money you will save in this {title} you could easily pay the full price, and have money to spare ... i guess i could go lower, but honestly {price} is the best i can do.
p7956
aVyou have a good point. {partner_price} is a good deal.
p7957
ag960
aVthank you.

p7961
aVdoes it have new tires, and how many miles does it have on it?
p7962
aVit does have new tires and 118000 miles
p7963
aVi could do {price} cash and pick it up today
p7964
aVhow about {price}?
p7965

p7970
aVhi. it's a great {title}. you will sleep like a baby on it. i can take {price}. how about that? i can deliver it to you for free also.
p7971
aVfor only a {title} that is used that's a little out of my price range. i could pay {my_price} in cash and pick it up today if that works for you?
p7972
aVi can accept that! thanks

aVgreat! the {title} is a reliable car, and i have it priced at {listing_price}
p7978
aVwow, thats really steep. its only a 1999. i can really only go {price}.

aVas much as i'd like to be, we can work on a price. what are you thinking?
p7995
aVi was thinking maybe around {price}
p7996
aVoh wow. that's much lower than i anticipated. i am trying to get rid of it, but i'd also not like to lose out on it. how about {price}?
p7997
aVi could go {price} and pick it up.
p7998
aV{my_price} is the lowest i'm willing to go. it's a great phone and {my_price} is a steal!
p7999
aVdoes it come with the charger and any accessories?

p8006
aVcould you do an even {price}? today would be great to pick them up
p8007
aVand there is nothing wrong with them?
p8008

p8013
aVit appears scratched, but works great!
p8014
aVhonestly i just need a bike to be able to get to work right now. someone stole my car which had my purse and all my stuff in it i have been down on my luck and this bike sounds perfect. how low are you willing to go?
p8015
aVoh, i'm so sorry! it's such a great bike, that i have been re-building. could you buy it for {price}?
p8016
aVi could, but then i wouldn't have enough money for food this week since my purse was stolen too. would you mind accepting {price} i really wouldn't usually ask but considering my situation i could really use the help.
p8017
aVthat is a bit too low, but, i'm willing to meet in the middle. how about {price}?
p8018
aVwhat about one more offer at {my_price} and i can come pick it up?

p8025
aVthats okay. i am busy today. can you lower the price a bit for the poor college student? i can offer {price}

p8033
aVhow far away is it from stores and what is the flooring like also does it come with any appliances?
p8034
aVit does come with washer and dryer. about 1 mile from supermarket, flooring is hardwood and new carpet.
p8035
aVthat's good. the house is kind of in a bad part of town so i think it's a little overpriced are you flexible at all when it comes to the price?
p8036
aVit is located in a good part of the neighborhood, and might give some consideration to price, though it is certainly comparable to other rates in this neighborhood.
p8037
aVwill you take {price} that's kind of where my budget is right now
p8038
aVsorry, bout couldn't go that low. could go down to {price}.
p8039
aVi can come up to {price} if you throw in utilities that possible?

aVis there any way you could come off a couple bucks? i've got {price} bucks on me now and really don't want to go to the bank since i don't have a car.

aVi love this phone would love to have it for {price}.
p8435
aV{partner_price} is a little low from what i am asking. it is unblocked, very clean and has a nice 16gig storage. i was asking {listing_price} but i can go down to at least {price}.
p8436
aVi will take the {price} deal if you throw in a pair of headphones.

p8441
aVoh that's great! what would you like to know?
p8442
aVany damage to it?
p8443
aVwell, no `` damage'' really, just wear and tear from age, the seats inside have tears here and there, paint outside could be redone
p8444
aVi am looking to buy pretty quickly. what year is it?
p8445
aVit's a {title}, and i'm looking to sell quickly, so it sounds like you found the right guy!
p8446
aVthe year i was born! what is the lowest you would be willing to go on this?
p8447
aVi mean, i need to get rid of it, but it's sentimental to me too, i think {price} is fair, you?
p8448
aVi understand completely. if i was to come today, with cash in hand, would you take {price}?
p8449
aVif you promise to come today, we have a deal.

aVthat's a cute listing i must say
p8453
aVhaha, the idea was to attract attention.
p8454
aVi see, is it in all good condition or does it have some wear and tear that i have to take care of?
p8455
aVit has much wear and tear, it's a pretty beat up old thing.
p8456
aVhmm ... i know {listing_price} is cheap but can you do {price} because of the condition?
p8457
aVi suppose so, but you would have to pick it up.
p8458
aVumm ... that's slightly inconvenient for me because of my physical condition ... let's do {price} with you arranging for delivery
p8459
aVsounds like a plan!
p8460

aVno problem. i appreciate you taking the time to do that.
p8466
aVit does work. it is in excellent shape for it's age. the color and graphics are really nice on this.
p8467
aVi can imagine. i am into {title} items and would like to get this before someone else does. i really only want to spend {price} on it, but could offer a deposit on it if that is too low.
p8468
aVi am really looking to get this sold asap. could you do {price} on it?
p8469
aVyes, i would be willing to buy for {partner_price}. it is in excellent shape and feel that is a fair price.

aVyes, they are in great shape. like i said it is just the handel and the padded seat that we have fixed with tape.
p8491
aVi am interested and would like to pick it up today. i think {listing_price} is kind of high would you be willing to take {price}?
p8492
aVi can't take {partner_price}, i need more than that. i would be willing to go down to {price}.
p8493
aVhow about {price} and i will be on my way now with cash?

p8499
aVwell, you haven't seen any pictures yet. i will get them on later today. if you still want it how about {price}
p8500

p8506
aVi would when can i come over for a showing? or if you want you can just describe the interior and condition and we can make a deal right here right now.
p8507
aVi can't do {partner_price} just to be fair to my other tenants. i'd be willing to do {price} and not require a deposit. would that help?
p8508
aVthat helps tremendously thank you for working with me.
p8509

aVno problem. i think you'll love this place.
p8510
aS'<accept>'
p8511
aVwow, its hard to come past one of these used. may i ask why you are selling it?
p8512
aVbelieve it or not, i got two for a birthday present!
p8513
aVwow, you are lucky! i am super interested in it. does it come with any warranty information?
p8514
aVwell, that's all i got!;) it does come with a warranty. i don't think you'll be disappointed. and, you'll be the envy of your friends!
p8515
aVi hope that we can reach a price on such a rare item! you can treat yourself to a new birthday present. i only have {price} in cash.
p8516
aVhello!
p8517
aVhi i am very interested in your {title}.
p8518
aVi'm very glad to hear that! i am trying to sell them for {listing_price} since i have never used them and they are {title}.
p8519
ag960
aVi understand that they are new and all but i was hoping that you would be willing to come down on the price. my son was just in a car accident with his dad and will be stuck in his bed for a while. he would love these. i can really only afford {price} though
p8520
aVdefinetely can't do that, it's way too low. sorry.

aS'<quit>'
p8522
aVhello are you interested in renting my {title}?
p8523
aVyes i am. i am relocating and am in need of an {title}. it is super cute. is the internet provided or do i pay for it myself?
p8524
aVyou would have to pay for it yourself but it is close to a park and close to starbucks and whole foods market!
p8525
aVok that is fair enough. i work from home so would have to get that hooked up immediately. the starbucks is a perk of the neighborhood. would you be willing to negotiate on the price? i need to move asap.
p8526
aVi love your {title}. it is really a place i could call home. what amenities are included?
p8527
aVit is in a prime location. close to public transportation. a great spot for a young professional or a young couple
p8528
aVwonderful. does it allow pets? i have a turtle i have had for 20 years that would be moving with me.
p8529
aVyes a turtle would be allowed with no fee.
p8530
aVwonderful, i appreciate that. i need to move asap. what would be the lowest you'd be willing to go on this property?
p8531
aVif you could move in asap i can lower it to {price}
p8532
aVi could put the deposit down today for {partner_price}. i wanted it a little lower but since i dont have to pay a pet fee i think that is fair. thank you so much!

p8535
aVyes i interested.
p8536
aVany questions?
p8537
aVhow is the engine?
p8538
aVit's in great shape, it hums quietly. my son says there aren't any major issues with it, the only minor issue is the airbag light comes one and stays on every once in a while.
p8539
aVoh that's ok. my old car's engine light says on all the time even though the engine is fine. what year model is it?
p8540
aVyeah, i had a car like that and they could never find anything wrong with it. this is a {title}.
p8541
aVhow is the air conditioner because it is so hot now and my current car's air don't work.
p8542
aVthe air works great. it blows cold and cools the car quick.
p8543
aVwonderful. how much are you asking? is there room to negotiate?
p8544
aVwell we're asking {listing_price}.
p8545
aVhow about {price}?

p8549
ag3258
aVhello i am very interested in your item. i can pay {price} for it.
p8550
aV{partner_price} is a little too low for it. how bout we talk a bit more. it is in great condition and it was {price} dollars when i bought it. i need a bit more for it, if it is not too much trouble.
p8551
aVi just sank myself in debt building this music studio. {price} is the highest i can go.
p8552
aVokay {partner_price} can work, but you will need to pick it up as well. is that alright with you?
p8553
aVyou've got a deal.
p8554
ag960
aVhave a good day. thanks for doing business with me.
p8555
aS'<accept>'
p8556
aVhello. are you interested in the car?
p8557
aVhi! yep, is it in good condition?
p8558
aVyes, everything runs like new. i replaced everything specifically to sell it, so no need to fix or replace everything. i did an oil change, got the timing belt checked out, added new tires and rim, and a lot of other stuff.
p8559
aVthat sounds great. but i see in the description that the airbag light is on, will probably cost me a few hundred to get that checked. would you be willing to come down on price a bit?
p8560
aVi can get that looked at and fixed for you if you'd like.
p8561
aVokay, so the listing is at {listing_price}. what do you say if i pay {price} in cash today and pick up the car myself, no need to even check the airbag light?
p8562
aValright sounds good to me. you've got a deal

p8565

p8566
aVhello, i'm not certain of its age. it has been an heirloom in the family for over 25 years.
p8567
aVid love to take it off your hands for {price}
p8568
aVthat is a little lower than i would like to accept. right now the lowest i can take is {price}.
p8569
aVargh ... id really like this ... how about {price}?
p8570
aVokay, {partner_price} sounds good!
p8571
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p8572
aVhi! i would like to make an offer of {price} dollars for the {title}.
p8573
aVgreat would you like to know more information about the {title}?
p8574
aVwhat else is there to know? it's untested, i need to pick it up, and i need to pay cash. i can maybe go as high as {price} dollars.
p8575

p8577
aVhey there!

p8579
aVhmm. that actually sounds very reasonable, and i'm trying to get rid of this sooner rather than later. if we can call it an even {price} then you have yourself a deal!
p8580
aVexcellent you have a deal. thank you so much. i see that this car has a lot of sentimental value to you as well and i want you to know that it is in good hands. thanks again!

p8585
aVyes it is! do you have any questions?
p8586
aVwell does the price include any utilities, is there a washer and dryer and do you have any specials going on right now, the price is a bit much for me
p8587
aVthere is a laundry and it does include utilities, but there are no specials. sorry but this place is in high demand, so i don't have time for lowballing. i can help and drop the price a bit to {listing_price}.
p8588
aVhowdy, so whatcha think-a my bike here?
p8589
aVi'm actually really interested in it, but i think it's a little pricey. would you be willing to knock it down a bit?
p8590
aVso you think {listing_price} is a little too high? i never used it for competition and this is one of the best japanese bikes every produced, not easy to find here in the us
p8591
aVi can understand that, but my problem is that i'm on a really tight budget. would you be willing to go for
p8592

p8605
aVyes i am very much interested in it. how long has it been used?
p8606
aVonly a year. it does not have many miles on it at all. how much are you looking to pay for it?
p8607
aVi am willing to pay {price}
p8608
aVhow about {price}? it is in great condition. i don't think {partner_price} is high enough for me.
p8609
aVdoes {price} work? i really cant afford much just now as i have to pay off my student loans. i would appreciate you helping me out here. i mean i can give you the amount right away as that what i have saved for my car.

p8615
aVit only has around 70,000 miles on it. i am the first owner with title in my name. are you interested?
p8616
aVi am very interested. are you willing to offer a lower price if i am able to come test drive the vehicle and bring cash or a certified check in person? i can come as soon as today if the price is right
p8617
aVi will let it go for {price} dollars if you are coming to me. however, if you want to negotiate any lower than that i will have to swap out the wheels for some base model {title} wheels i have that aren't as nice as the ones in the photo.
p8618
aVhi is the apartment still available for rent?
p8619
aVhello. yes it is. are you interested in it?
p8620
aVyes! my last apartment burned down a few days ago, so i'm desperate for a place. can you tell me about it?
p8621
aVsorry to hear that. this apartment is in a great neighborhood. it has wide windows in the kitchen and it has all the major conveniences.
p8622
aVyeah the pictures all look really good and that's great utilities are included. when's the soonest i could move in?
p8623
aVnext week
p8624
aVok can you negotiate on the price with me? i'm willing to pay {price} a month and i'll sign a 2 year lease.

p8632
aVsurely there is always negotiation room? since they are used somewhat i would like to offer {my_price} for them.
p8633
aVi am sorry that is way to below my asking price, and no there is not much wiggle room for the new barely 4 week old headphones and because they are {title} they are not cheap. best i could accept for this item would be {price} for pick up. i just posted this ad and have had many responses so these headphones wont be around long.
p8634

p8635

p8669
aVyes i am wondering how bad the scratches are? and could you take less?
p8670
aVthe scratches are really fine and not noticeable to anyone passing by. you would have to inspect the car closely to reveal them.
p8671
aVhow is the motor? how many miles?
p8672
aVmotor is in great condition. i just replaced the time belt, water pump and cam seals. this was mainly used as a family car so the mileage is a little higher, but mainly highway.
p8673
aVwould you offer any warranty?
p8674
aVcar will be sold as is. what about {price}?
p8675

p8729
aVit's in a really highly sought after location. it's also a very nice unit that will be freshly painted. this is around the price you could expect in the area. if you're willing to sign a longer lease agreement i can come down a bit, though.
p8730
aVyes i could be willing to do that. how good is the area, and what condition is this property in?
p8731
aVthe area is very safe and very well kept. a lot of booming new businesses. you also have very nice views on this particular unit.
p8732
aVwould you be willing to sell for {price} if i move in right away and sign a longer lease?

aVlooks to me like the item is kind of very old. how hold is the {title}?
p8961
aVwell, yeah, it is an old part, and has been used a little, which is why the price is so dramatically low. its to fit an older model.
p8962
aVit is for use with models: 15, 66, 28, 27, 15-91, and 201. the part itself weighs about 15 grams.
p8963
aVoh great thanks for the info. can i offer you {price} dollars for it. its really old you know
p8964
aVit is old, because it is for an older {title}, as i said before. i am willing to negotiate, but {partner_price} dollars is ignorantly low.
p8965
aVhow low can you go then. can i pay 13.50. seems to me its okay at the price.

aVoh they don't fold down to expand the trunk? bummer. do you think you could take a little less for it then? does it have a clean carfax report?
p8996
aVi am willing to negotiate, however i can't accept offers that are too low. a carfax report can be provided upon request.
p8997

p9128
aVit does not but it does have a big {title} and it have a laundry room! this place is amazing.
p9129
aVhmm, {listing_price} seems a bit steep. i was hoping to find a 2 bedroom closer to the {price} range per month if the unit doesn't include utilities. do you at least pay for water, sewer and trash removal?
p9130
aVi could pay for the sewer and trash removal if you willing to accept my offer of {price} in i will pay your first light bill!

aVi don't think i could go so low as {title} price, but yes the price is negotiable.
p9139

p9204

p9208
aVsounds wonderful, will you be able to come down on your price at all?
p9209

p9210
aVi was hoping to save at least 100-200 on the rent from your asking price is this possible?
p9211
aVit may be possible. be aware there are no pets with this discount. it would be the {listing_price} plus an additional {price} per pet.

p9227
aVthe tables are in excellent condition. how about {price}?
p9228

p9240
aVit is a {title} car! that's a little higher than i was looking to pay ...
p9241
aVwell it's already an excellent deal. i'm afraid the lowest we can go is {price}. i hope this is reasonable for you, as we believe you won't find a better deal for such a nice car.

ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9243
aVhello i have kept this in very good condition there are no scratches. it has a shiny black glossy finish
p9244
aVit looks great, would you be willing to ship it. it's a bit far to drive for something so small. also would you take {price} for it?
p9245
aVi was thinking of {listing_price} since it is in great condition.
p9246

p9248
ag960

p9249
aVhi:-) what kind of shape is this in?
p9250
aVit's still in very good shape. i've only used it for basic road riding. no competitions or anything too intense.
p9251
aVnice:-) so no rusty bits or problems with chains or gears? i like why your're selling it, btw
p9252
aVthanks. yeah, no mechanical issues or worn out parts. it was a classic design, and i did my best to take care of it.
p9253
aVi understand they have different sizes for these bikes? i'm on the short side, would it work for me?
p9254
aVit's a 55 cm frame, which is designed for people5'6'' to5'9'', but of course you can adjust the handlebar and seat height to your preferences.
p9255
aVperfect, sorry about the dumb question. its listed for {listing_price}, but i only have a budget of {price}, could that work?
p9256
aVi think i could probably go {price}. would that work?
p9257
aVit's for such a good cause, i can't go as high as five though( i'm sorry) but i do have my mad money:-) it's not much, but i can get together {price} ...
p9258
aVi think that'll work for me. you seem like you're going to give it a great home.
p9259
aVi'll try:-) thanks!

aS'<accept>'
p9261
aVhi. i'm very much interested in your vette. but the price is a bit high for my wallet. could you go down to about {price}?
p9262
aVi would have to get a bit more than that. it has low miles and lots of extras!
p9263
aVi do see it has a lot of aftermarket additions ... would you at least be able to meet me in the middle between your listing price and my offer?
p9264
aVhow does {price} sound? it's really a very nice car and you won't be disappointed.
p9265
aVif you can do {price} i'll come write you the check today and we'd have a deal.

ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9268
aVhi! i'm interested in your {title}. is it in good condition?
p9269
aVit is is good condition. i am a bigger person and since one of the cushions is attached it makes the seat a little smaller than i was wanting, so this is why i am selling.
p9270
aVwell, i'm happy you are. could you maybe come down a little on the price? its a gift for my grandmother. is {price} acceptable?
p9271
aVi would love to be able to sell it for that but to replace this with another {title} in my house i am needing at least {price}. i could deliver today.
p9272
aVwould you consider {price} if i come get it?
p9273

p9278
aVwe have had it for about 5 years it was my sons before he got into girls and bands so now he no longer rides it. it's been in the garage a while. there is some slight rust on the frame where the front tire meets the bike, other than that its' in good shape
p9279
aVawesome! i could pick it up later from your place if that works for you. i have {listing_price} in cash.

aVwe have had it for 7 years, it's 7 years old. we bought it brand new from a local artisan. it's very sturdy. they don't build them like this any more.
p9285
aVit's a unique looking piece, which is part of why i'm so interested. i've never seen one like it before. has it ever been painted?
p9286
aVno, this is the original stain there are only a few scratches on the top
p9287
aVexcellent. i would have lost all interest if it had been painted. my mother always told me never to pay full price. {price}?

aVi'm really interested in the bike. you say it has less than 50 miles on it. how long have you owned it?
p9295
aVhi:-) it's an awesome bike, i've had it two years, i keep it in the garage and its in tip top shape!
p9296
aVi want the bike cut can't afford the {listing_price}, i can pay {price}
p9297
aVoh man, i am so sorry, i can't come down that low on it. i would maybe consider that a down payment, and we can do payments on it, if you're really serious.
p9298
aVi could do that.
p9299
aVokay, so let's say the {partner_price} is the first payment, and that leaves another {partner_price} due. how about two hundred a month? could you work that okay?
p9300
aVthat works.
p9301
ag960
aVcool, you're going to love this bike:-)

p9304
aVhi you want to buy the {title}?
p9305
aVyes i would love to! is it in good condition? not scratched or slow or anything?
p9306
aVno scratches, there is one pixel that is bright and lit up, but it works fine even with that, and it doesn't obscure your view. it's in really good shape and has an otterbox case that comes with it.
p9307
aVawesome! would you accept {price} for it in cash? i can stop by today and pick it up.
p9308
aV{price} even and you have a deal
p9309
aVokay that will work! thanks!

aS'<accept>'
p9311
aVyes i am! can you tell me how many people it can sit?
p9312
aVit can sit 4 without the inserts but if you add them( there are {price}) you could sit 8 comfortably.
p9313
aVi could do {price}! it also comes with 2 end tables and a coffee table. they are all in beautiful shape and barely used.
p9314
aVthat is great! i'm really not looking for a coffee table, but i'm sure they are also very nice. can we do {price}? i'm already over my budget i agreed on with my husband ...
p9315
aVyes we can do {partner_price}! you have a deal
p9316
ag960
aVperfect! thanks

p9319
aVgreat! the unit is available for immediate move in and it is in great condition.
p9320
aVis the neighborhood nice?
p9321
aVit's very nice and quiet. there is a front yard and a back yard, so lots of space.
p9322
aVcool, would you be able to move the price down a bit if i sign a longer lease? i was thinking a year for {price}.
p9323
aVif you have good references, can do security and first and last month, we could definitely negotiate the price. we could do {price} for a one year lease.
p9324
aVthat works for me. you've got a deal!
p9325
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9326
aVhello.
p9327
aVhi, i've always wanted an {title}. i would love to buy this from you. are you he only to have owned it since the 80's?
p9328
aVyeah, just me. i've only used it for simple road riding, never used it for competitions. it has been very well maintained and is in great condition.
p9329
aVwould you accept {price} for it?
p9330
aVi don't think i could go that low. i am asking {listing_price} and this is a really great piece of japanese worksmanship.
p9331
aVi understand. how about {price}
p9332
aVi mean ... you're just throwing numbers at me ... i am asking {listing_price}. i can take {price} off if you come pick it up tonight and pay cash. but that's about all i can do.
p9333
aVwell thanks anyway
p9334
aS'<quit>'
p9335
ag3956
aVhi, is this {title} in good condition?
p9336
aVyes it is. it is in great shape. i just don't have any need for it anymore.
p9337
aVit looks like you had it pretty weighted down. i didn't know {title} furniture could hold that much weight. i'd like to buy it for {price}
p9338
aVhow about {price} and i will bring it to you myself?
p9339
aVsounds good!
p9340
ag960
aVi think we should make sure we want to do this deal. do you want to come take a look at it first?
p9341
aS'<accept>'
p9342
ag3962
aVhello, so you just bought your {title}. did you ride it a lot? are the tires worn out?
p9343
aVfrom the picture everything looks {title}, although i'd probably get a different saddle for it. would you take {price}?
p9344
aVi might. want to come by and take a look at it?
p9345
aVi'm going out of town tomorrow i can come pick it up today and pay cash
p9346
aVthat sounds good to me. i want to get rid of it quick, so i will accept your offer.
p9347
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9348
aVhello, are there any issues with the {title} i should know about?
p9349
aVit is a beautiful honey maple color. it is in very good condition with just a few minor usage on the top.
p9350
aVokay well the color is not good for me. since i'll have to restain it, how about {price} for it?
p9351
aVi can take {partner_price} but it has to be cash and you have to come pick it up.
p9352
aVyou've got a deal.
p9353
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9354
aVhi how are you?
p9355
aVi'm good, how about yourself? are you interested in my vette?
p9356
aVi'm great, and yes i am interested and hoping to reach an agreement with you.
p9357
aVokay, what were you thinking?
p9358
aVi was hoping to give you {price} and then i may have some items that you would like that i could throw in to make it a fairer deal for you.
p9359
aVfirst i need to make sure that just because you won't pay a higher price you won't value it at a higher price. this car has to go to someone who will take good care of it and keep it in good condition
p9360
aVoh i see the value and should say that i love cars and treat them very nicely!
p9361
aVokay, what else do you have to offer me?
p9362
aVwell i have a john boat and also some tools and i have some other things, is there anything in particular that you would want?
p9363
aVnothing that i can think of that's worth {price}
p9364
aVokay i didn't really want to part with this but i see that you're looking for something very special and rare. i just so happen so have something that you may consider. these are special herbs from overseas and you can not get them in usa. these are coming from an ancient culture of indigenous peoples. i met the shaman of the people and he gifted for me several pounds of this different types of herbs, i could part myself with 2lbs of this one that is very good for you and then give you {price}? will this work for you?
p9365
aV{partner_price} and the tools, do you have a hydraulic jack or a welder?
p9366
aVi do i have both and am willing to also put these into the pile.
p9367
ag960

p9368
ag3986
aVhello there, are you interested in the {title}? do you have any questions about it?
p9369
aVi am very interested in it. is it in good condition?
p9370
aVit's in very good condition and very well taken care of. the mattress is also in good condition.
p9371
aVgreat. i would like to come by and take a look at it. can you lower the price at all?
p9372
aVi may be able to come down a bit for you, what do you have in mind?
p9373
aVi would like to pay {price} for it. is that possible?
p9374
aVthat's a pretty low price for this {title}. you can't find them anymore in solid wood. i could do {price},
p9375
aVthat works for me
p9376
ag960
aVgreat
p9377
aS'<accept>'
p9378
aVhi, are you looking for a place in fairfield?
p9379
aVyes i am and this place looks awesome but over my budget. can you work with me?
p9380
aVyes i can, i am able to offer your some other perks as well that might even it out for you a bit, do you have any questions about the apartment?
p9381
aVyes, are utilities included and does it have washer and dryer hookups?
p9382
aVthe washer and dryer are included and the utilities is something that i am authorized to offer you as an extra, if you are willing to come in this week and start the process?
p9383
aVi can most definitely do that if the price is {title}. since the place is so small, i'm willing to offer {price}
p9384
aVi understand your position with the minimum wage in ca being only 10.50. do you have a good job here?
p9385
aVnot yet which is why i can't pay too much until i have stable income.
p9386
aVhi i am interested in your {title}. how does the a c work?
p9387
aVit works perfectly, really great condition!
p9388
aVawesome, how many miles does this baby have on it?
p9389
aVyou won't believe this, but only 5,000 miles!
p9390
aVwow, that's incredible. how firm is that price?
p9391
aVyeah i bought it for rap video shoots. so mostly women just sat on the hood of it. price is pretty firm, it's a steal though imo
p9392
aVawesome. i can only do around {price} right now. is it cool if i pay you the rest in a month. we can draw up a contract?
p9393
aVhmmmmm. can you do {price} right now and pick it up yourself? i'm about 60 miles outside of the city.
p9394
aVokay sounds good to me.
p9395
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9396
aVhi how are you {title}?
p9397
aVgreat! hope you're doing well.
p9398
aVi am. so are you interested in my apartment?
p9399
aVi am! i was hoping for a lower price though. i was thinking {price}
p9400
aVoh that is much too low. this apartment is in a very high demand area and does include all of the utilities.
p9401
aVi see that, it looks great. what would you be willing to go down to?
p9402
aVi plan on staying in this area for quite awhile. what could you do for a 5 year lease with 2 months rent up front?
p9403
aVwith a 5 year lease i could go down as low as {price} a month but that is the lowest that i am able to go. would that work for you?
p9404
aVyes, that sounds great!
p9405
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9406
aVyes it is. it's ready to go today
p9407
aVis it in good shape? and do you have any idea what the age recomendation is for this size?
p9408
aVthis {title} is the perfect size for a 7-10 year old. and it is in very good shape. my kid prefers to skate so he hardly used it.
p9409
aVperfect my 8 year old would love it. would you be willing to take {price} for it? i can come right away.
p9410
aVwell i'd like to buy a pack of skittles so how about {price}?
p9411
aVi can do {partner_price} for it that sounds fair. thank you.
p9412
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9413
aVhi i really like it. do you know if anyone could help me load it if i was to come pick it up?
p9414
aVi would definitely be willing to help you and we have easy elevator access to get it from my apartment to the driveway
p9415
aVcool. i would be willing to pay the full {listing_price} then. you got yourself a deal!
p9416
ag960

p9417
aS'<accept>'
p9418
aVhello, are you interested in the 2br 1bath?
p9419
aVi am! would you be willing to go down if i signed a multi-year lease?
p9420
aVi require a one year lease to start then you have a month to month option or another year.
p9421
aVi was looking to pay around {price}
p9422
aVthis is a newly renovated apartment. fully remodeled. it has new carpet and fresh paint. minute s from bart access. it's going for {listing_price} right now. that's a steal for the area.
p9423
aVhi! i'm interested in your {title}. how worn is it?
p9424
aVit's not worn very much. it's 20 years old but the stain is still in great condition.
p9425
aVits says fair condition, any scuffs or scratches in the wood?
p9426
aVthere's just some wear on the bottom inside of the legs. it's not really scratches in the wood as much as it is small scratches in the stain. you can see them when the light hits it the right way.
p9427
aVi really like the hanging wine-glass rack. would you take {price}? it is 20 years old after all.
p9428
aVhi were you interested in my {title}?
p9429
aVi am can you tell me a little more about the condition
p9430
aVit's in fair condition. theres a bit of scratching in the coating. nothing has worn into the wood. nothing crazy. it's 20 years old.
p9431
aVi am actually wanting it for a project so i really don't want to spend too much. would you take {price} i mean it is rather old and dated.
p9432
aVif you are willing to come pick it up i could let it go for {price}
p9433
aVi can come right now that is perfect thank you very much.
p9434
ag960

p9437
aVhello, the {title} is brand new, unlocked. i am asking {listing_price} for it
p9438
aVwould you take {price} cash right now?
p9439
aVthat is a bit out of my ballpark sorry, if you come pick it up i could perhaps go a bit lower since you would be saving me the time and gas but i don't see it going that low.
p9440
aVhow about {price} and i will come right now to pick it up?
p9441
aVmake it an even {price} and we have ourself a deal.
p9442
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9443
aVhello, how are you?
p9444
aVhello im good, youre interested in my apartment?
p9445
aVyes! i love the location of it and the access to everything. my only problem though is that i think {listing_price} is a lot for what looks like a small space, would you consider lowering the price?
p9446
aVwell the price is because of its amazing location and {title} views. it is also fully remodeled and new carpet new paint
p9447
aVi do like all of that, like i said though i could only afford a reduced price, like 1500-1900.
p9448
aVthe lowest i'm allowed to offer is {price}
p9449
aVyou know what, that's fine. i will do {partner_price} if thats fine with you since i'm so excited about your views and location.
p9450
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9451
aVhello, i am interested in the {title} you have
p9452
aVhi. thanks for your interest.
p9453
aVwill the charger work on any {title}? i have both a samsung and an iphone and it would be great if it worked on both
p9454
aVsure! as i mentioned in the ad, the {title} are compatible with both android and apple ios.
p9455
aVoh sorry, it doesn't say that on my end. could you tell me a little about the single item in the green box that says `` snap''?
p9456
aVto be honest, i purchased the item as a bulk deal and haven't used the item. it comes as a bonus along with the selfie clicker and wall chargers.
p9457
aVoh these are all sold together i thought they were individual. i was going to offer {listing_price} for a selfie clicker and wall charger
p9458
aVsounds good to me. thanks.
p9459
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9460
aVhey! i see that you are interested in the apartment!
p9461
aVyes, i was wondering if you accept pets as well?
p9462
aVwe do allow pets, and the hardwood flooring helps clean after them easier as well.
p9463
aVis the yard fenced by chance. i like to let my dogs run wild.
p9464
aVim sorry, if you want to do these hits, you are going to have to be a little quicker, and actually try. i am not here to roleplay.
p9465
aVwell. you clearly didnt read the directions.
p9466
ag960
aS'<quit>'
p9467
aVhey there if you still have the bike, i am interested.
p9468
aVyes! i am, its {listing_price}
p9469
aVwhy are you getting rid of it? is it trashed?
p9470
aVnope, im thinking of getting another bike and don't have space for {title} in my apartment
p9471
aVwill you take {price} for it?
p9472
aVthats too low! how about {price} and i transfer the one year warranty it has on it?
p9473
aVi can do that thank you man. so ready to get back out on the trails.

ag960
aVgreat!
p9475
aS'<accept>'
p9476
aVhello, are you interested in my {title}?
p9477
aVi am, how firm on are on the {listing_price} you are asking? would you be willing to go lower on that price if i came soon with cash in hand?
p9478
aVyes i would be willing to do that but this {title} has a super rare peugot frame made in canada! it can even be shortened, too, for smaller people to ride. what price were you thikning of?
p9479
aVideally i would like to pay {price} for this. it is an older used {title}, the fact that it is super rare makes it harder to get any parts for it and i will have to deal with possible tire dry rot and anything else wrong with it.
p9480
aVyou raise some valid points. could we do an even {price}?
p9481
aVi can swing {partner_price}. ill see you this evening?

p9488
aVthanks for the information. i can't do {listing_price}, but would you be willing to accept {price} for it?
p9489
aVdo you have a track and can come pick it up?
p9490
aVi don't have a truck so i would need it delivered.
p9491
aVif you need me to deliver i'm at {listing_price} firm. do you have anything you can trade as well?
p9492
aVi'm sorry but i have nothing else to trade. i'll rent a truck and pick it up if you can do {price}.

p9601
aVhello, are you interested in my car?
p9602
aVhi there. yes i am very much interested. how old is it?
p9603
aVgreat, it's a {title}.
p9604
aVyes but it says its sat for more than 10 years. does it still run well? i mean ten years is a really really long time!
p9605
aVyes, it hasn't been driven in 10 years but it works fine! i drove it recently to update the tags and confirm the title, for a {title} car it runs well.
p9606
aVwhen was the last service done?
p9607
aVabout 6 months ago, i can show you papers if you decide you want to come and check out the car. if you are seriously interested you can also test drive it around first.
p9608
aVgreat! yes i am really interested but the price is high for me. is there any room for negotiation here? i am ready to pay {price}
p9609
aVhmm, well since it's so old i'm willing to drop the price down but since it's also in great condition i want to make sure it's sold for its value. i don't want to sell it for under {price}.
p9610
aVwell that's what i can afford. please if you can consider something i would appreciate it. i am a student and really desperate for a car at the moment and my budget is what i mentioned.
p9611
aVim sorry but like i said i don't want to under sell the car, since you are a student and have a tight budget i will drop to {price} but nothing below.
p9612

aS'<accept>'
p9614
aVhello, i'm here to inquire what you're selling exactly?
p9615
aVhi, yeah the ad got really garbled and it doesn't make much sense now does it? i'm selling an {title}. it is brand new.
p9616
aVthank you for clearing that up. i'm definitely interested in buying, is there anyway we could negotiate a price? i have about {price} to spend. i would be willing to trade you my current phone as well if that would help any? i'm also willing to drive to you to pick it up today.
p9617
aVwell i don't really have use for a used phone. and {price} is considerably lower than the asking price, which is already very reduced for a brand new {title} ...
p9618
aVwhat else does the phone come with? i'm pretty tight on a budget and {my_price} is already more than i was willing to spend, but i was hoping to come to some sort of agreement. i'm definitely not here to waste your time and appreciate you talking to me.
p9619
aVwell the phone comes with an accessories kit that includes a charger, a case, and that sort of thing
p9620
aVwould you take {price} and my current phone? you could sell it and make a profit close to what you're asking for. i'm also willing to come pick it up still.
p9621
aVno there is no way i can sell a brand new {title} for {partner_price}. i can do {price} if you are willing to pay cash and come get it right now.

p9644
aVsure! it's a wonderful vintage {title}. it's 47'' long, 26.5'' high and has a depth of 18.5''. it's in good condition with beveled wood drawers and chrome wheels. i hate to get rid of it but i'm downsizing and won't have room for it.
p9645
aVi completely understand! i think i saw one just like it at a flea market recently, but the price was a bit lower ... would you be willing to take {price} cash if i come today to get it?
p9646
aVi can't go that high right now ... i'm sorry. the best i can do would be {price}.

p9663
aVsitting for 10 years must have really hurt the car. i could use some parts, though. what's the asking price?
p9664
aVi'm asking {price} for it! it runs great!! the interior is in excellent condition.
p9665
aVthe parts wouldn't be worth that much to me

p9823
aVi see in your ad it says that the {title} are weathered some but still functional, about how old are they?
p9824
aVi've used them for 2 summers. very comfortable, and quite fashionable if i do say so myself.
p9825
aVok, that sounds pretty good. i really could use a pair of {title} for my patio. would you accept {price} for them?
p9826
aVit is a great deal for you, but i no longer have room for these. so i will do {partner_price}.

p9840
aVyes, the {title} is still available. would you be interested?
p9841
aVis it just the one bedroom? all i saw was the master bedroom listed.
p9842
aVyes, it only has a master bedroom, but it is exceptional.
p9843
aVis there any wiggle room on the price? i found another apartment {title} to this but it was about {price} cheaper. i'm trying to do some research.
p9844
aVyeah, i could come down a bit, what are you thinking?
p9845
aVi was hoping to do all in {price}( water and trash included).
p9846
aVthat's a bit lower than i can go, everything is up to date and it's {title} to a lot of sites. i was originally looking to get {listing_price}. you seem like you would be a great fit for the apartment. how about {price}?
p9847
aVsorry, that's a bit more than i can afford at this time. thank you though.
p9848
aVi could even go as low as {price}, if that would help you out.
p9849
aVthank you for the offer, i'd need to stay below {partner_price} a month with utilities, so unfortunately i don't think it will be a good fit. it's a beautiful place though!
p9850
aVyeah, it is great. you really seem like you would be a great fit. how about {price} and i'll pay the water, sewer, garbage, and cable.

p9855
aVhow fast does it go
p9856
aVvery fast! you only need a battery.
p9857
aVgreat i can afford {price}
p9858
aVthat's far too low. that's below market value for a bike of this size in this condition. i'm willing to sell it for {price} plus, i will deliever it to your house at no additional charge.
p9859
aVi can afford {price} and i can pick it up
p9860
aVwhat about {price}? that's the lowest i'm willing to go. i'm pretty sure you won't be able to find another bike like this. it's a classic.

aVgood evening! yes, it is still available. you're more than welcome to come see it. i'm asking {listing_price}.
p9886
aVif you can have 3 months up front, yes i could lock you in at {price}. i have another potential renter coming tomorrow at 5pm if it's still open, so could you do the 3 months and make it by 5 tomorrow?
p9887

p9892
aVyes they look great and they are compatible with both android and iphone
p9893
aVthats great. do you have them in various colors?
p9894
aVyes but at this time we only offer green and black
p9895
aVokay sounds good to me. they're new correct? never used?
p9896
aVyes they are brand new in the box
p9897
aVwould you accept {price} for them?
p9898
aVi think that's a fair price, sure!
p9899

p9901
aVhello! so you are interested in this very desirable apartment?
p9902
aVhi! yes i am, how close to the base is it?
p9903
aVit's just minutes away from the base.
p9904
aVi could do {partner_price}. and ok i can buy the new car i want. one more question, is it gated?
p9905
aVyes, it is gated. {my_price} is a deal!
p9906
ag960
aVgreat!
p9907
aS'<accept>'
p9908
aVhi i am interested in your {title}
p9909
aVgreat! any questions?
p9910
aVyes i do. how are the insides of the car? is the interior in good shape?
p9911
aVthe interior is tan leather and is in good shape considering that it hasn't been used much
p9912
aVi am looking to add an additional car and this {title} looks like it would be good to have. how many miles does it have?
p9913
aVit has less than {price}
p9914
aVare you willing to go lower with the price?
p9915
aVyes, at least {price}
p9916
aVi was wanting to offer you {price} for it
p9917
aVi can do {price} if you pay up front
p9918
aVnot too bad of a deal, sure, that will work
p9919
ag960
aS'<accept>'
p9920
aVhello!
p9921
aVhello, is the {title} still available?
p9922
aVyes, it is. would you like to see it?
p9923
aVbefore i see it, i have a few questions. are any utilities included in the rent. {listing_price} is a bit much and are pets allowed?
p9924
aVno, utilities are not included, and small pets are allowed with a pet deposit. keep in mind that you could have 18 or more people sharing the rent, depending on how you furnish the bedrooms, so that brings down the per-person price a lot!
p9925
aVyeah, more people equals less per person, but i don't want too big a crowd. some people just aren't clean. how about we start out at {price} for 5 people and renegotiate later if i need to bring more people in?
p9926
aVthat's less than half price! my boss would kill me! i can't go lower than {price}. how many people you share with is up to you.
p9927
aVokay, i'm just trying to save you the eviction process if we can't pay. i think i can find {price} more people and get you {partner_price} but we'll need water and gas covered.
p9928
aVi could do that.
p9929

p9931

p9932
aVyou can come and look at it for sure. i'd like {listing_price} for it. you won't be disappointed.
p9933
aVhey, {price} and you have a deal.
p9934
aVare you paying cash?
p9935
aVyes, i am.
p9936
aVthen {partner_price} will do it. do you need help loading it?
p9937

p9939
aS'<accept>'
p9940
aVhey i'll give you {price} for the place
p9941
aVwell, the asking price is {listing_price} i feel that {partner_price} is a little on the low side, but i'm willing to negotiate.

p10016
aVthat is at least more reasonable. however, it is still too low. if you lease for 2 years, i will drop to {price} and that is a final offer.
p10017
ag960
aVi am sorry. {my_price} is the most i can do.
