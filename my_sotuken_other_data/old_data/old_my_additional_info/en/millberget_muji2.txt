Purchased for the daughter who became an elementary school student. It matches desk of solid material and is familiar with interior very much and is satisfied very much. However, while sitting, my feet do not reach the floor, I will move with my throbbing with a little load. And my finger's fingers that I was lying next time will get caught .... The principal seemed troublesome to grab his desk and return to the original position many times, and it was changed to a chair used at the table. It may be fine if it is used in tatami and carpet.
I have used it for about 5 years. Easy to use is normal. I'm using cushions plus cushions for this cushion is hard. Also, although I give up and use it, it's pretty stressful because the back sounds so terrible. I think that this is fine for desk work and light learning, but it seems better to buy a chair for it for the body because the person who desks at all for more than 6 hours (especially in the forward tilted postures) kekked for the body.
