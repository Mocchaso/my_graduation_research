I like designs that are simple even in the usual way. Because the desk is white, I made it gray. The real thing is better than the picture. It is helpful to pay it to the desk completely with a good knee height. Although it was certain that there were some difficult parts due to parts at the time of a set up group, five stars with cheering Nitori.
Purchased red together with PC desk. The color is also as red as the photo, not red but a calm feeling red. Sitting comfort is just right to work. The backrest is also exactly rigid. Assembly is about 25 minutes by one person. The price is also reasonable, so I think whether it is enough as a performance. Since the backrest will not collapse, I think that I can not recommend it to those who want to defeat the backrest.
The color is very calm. It does not feel dark at all, it feels elegant. Although the comfort of the cushion is also quite nice, the fabric feels a bit gritty, I'm sitting on a cover. A little disappointing, the part of the center cylinder protrudes from the lower base. No matter how much I looked for, there were no parts to squeeze, so I think that it probably is not wrong to assemble. (I am using it without problems) But it is still a bit uneasy, unlike the explanatory diagram. So I made four stars.
