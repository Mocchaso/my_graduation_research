I purchased it for the storage of children's clothing. There were several colors, and I made the child choose the color. Were they able to pick up colors themselves so that the consciousness to say their own things seemed to have grown, they started to clean up. Also, needless to say, it is easy to assemble, but I got few garbage when assembling it. It is also very high point to say that there are less intelligence. Although I wrote without ramblings, it is a satisfactory product.
It is just right size to put underwear, socks, towels in a dressing room. It is easy to assemble and it is good that dust does not enter.
Very easy to use! Children are also working hard on storage!
Although I was worried because there was a voice that assembly was difficult in other reviews, I could do it by one woman without looking at the assembly manual. There are parts of the bus towel and storage capacity as it is also in the item description, but I think that it is exactly right for storage of one's living. However, it has a cheap impression when putting it in the living room, so I use it in the closet.
There is considerable time and power to assemble. Finished goods are unexpectedly shabby.
Star 5 is good because it is easy to use, but I have assembled it myself, there is a place I can not do well and I have to remove it and I can not go back until I have to assemble it again. It was very difficult. I had a hard time to remove it as it is written without having a hard time.
