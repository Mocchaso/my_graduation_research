I use it by putting it on the bedside. It was easy to assemble, and I was able to do it by myself in a blink of an eye. Because two drawers are pecking, it is convenient to be able to put on glasses and books to read before going to bed. Since there is space to store the cord, the code of the charger etc of the smartphone can also be refreshed.
I am satisfied. Simple and user-friendly is the best! ! I did not put it in Nitori 's store and the correspondence of Nitori' s clerk was not good, so purchase with Rakuten! !
Texture is good. I think cost performance is high, but it is easy to get scratched.
Usability is good. I can not take out any smell of drawers and it smells very much. Leaving the drawer open to take out the smell makes my head hurt.
