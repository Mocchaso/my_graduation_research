Tighten the screws and lay it sideways, just the screws and screws strike, so subtly it? I got a gap. I guess I had to tighten it enough to snap into the board with an electric drill etc ....

The connection dabbo (protrusion of tree) part of the transverse board and the floor board is difficult. You can clean it by hitting the tapping and hitting the towel and filling the gap.

As the structure became known, it was assembled quickly, but again it is hard work alone. In addition, this time the gum tape is stuck on the back board and when you peel it the decorative sheet is turned over. In the busy season I had to call the consultation desk which is hard to connect, many times on the phone, and sent me a substitute article on arrival on the day. When this force was applied at the time of assembly, this back plate made the joint a pattern and it was very difficult. Also, during use, whenever a book or a box hits, it will be awkward, sounds, and it will be exciting. In order to solve these problems, the second unit stuck a splice plate in the middle of the back of the backboard. When two cars are arranged side by side, the first one has a gap of 2 millimeters between the side plate and the wheel, I am curious. Was the screw tightening at the time of assembly sweet?

Since the neighborhood was improved this time (the bar was reinforced in the center) this time I bought it again. However, it was hard to use heavy opening and closing of the drawer this time.",
            "The other day, I bought one and started using it, but the design and ease of use are good, I bought one more and used it. Because there is no drawer knob, I did not get caught, I thought that it was easy to match other interior. I also searched for other drawers, but when comparing the materials and prices, I pinned it \"This is it!\" By matching it with this table, I was able to coordinate what I asked for.",
            "I like being affordable and easy to use and durable. Purchased for desk drawers and shallow closures. Combine according to the application. I put personal computer, stationery, linen, hobby sewing supplies etc. If there are several depths, I would like to unify it by using it in other places.

I got an inquiry and it is an answer like that specification so I can not be satisfied. The price is cheap, so it is considered that there is no problem if considering that there is also a hit if it is said to be suitable for the price.

There are two shallow drawers on the top and two drawers on the bottom a little deeper, but neither of them will fit the A4 document file well. Particularly in the lower drawer, the opening (slide) distance is insufficient and the file can not be stored vertically. Therefore, since you have to stack documents and files flat, you can not see the spine and lack the suitability for office supplies.

Although it is easy to assemble, as in the review, the bottom of the chest, the screw to stop the roller is slightly big and not fit in size? It took me around 20 minutes to install if I was struggling with the struggle. If this is not there, it will be done in half an hour .... As a trick to install screws!

But turning down and pushing gently \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 powerfully turned the screw into it. It is recommended that hands with easy-to-wear force use T-shaped drivers.

Well I used it, I noticed that the corner was broken where I became. If you look closely well, the two similar parts (upper part of the case, both sides of the case) are broken or cracked. It was extremely simple packing (just putting the case in just-size cardboard), so it seems to have hit me during delivery. I also thought about using adhesive with adhesive, but since both of the two were damaged, we contacted them and exchanged them as expected. When exchanging, putting the corrugated card containing the case in a larger corrugated cardboard and inserting the cushioning material firmly was safe. I think that it would be better to stop over packaging, but I think that simple packaging is totally overwhelmed if the product gets scratched. I decided to write it here because I felt that I could prevent something like this just by wrapping it with cushioning material (bubble wrap etc.) and putting it in cardboard. I would be pleased if you could receive it as an opinion. The product of the essentials is also smooth and out of drawers and it comes with a casters so it is easy to clean up when cleaning, and likes the simple color form.

I think it can not be helped because it is a natural material, but this is just a different color if it is just this ... it just floats and looks there .... After I put it in a stacking shelf gladly, I lost my voice with shock.",

However, a distinctive smell is quite interesting. Also, when using in stacking shelf, there is no sense of stability, the difficulty. When pushing in the drawer, it conflicts with the wall behind the body. I wish I had a stopper."

            "Purchased one month ago. I use it as a PC chair. It is also cheap and easy to assemble with one person. It was more than I expected.",
            "Does not it personally match? Sciatic neuralgia has become worse and I am not using it now. The feeling of sitting is nice, but when I sit, there is a noise from the caster.",
            "The waist is very easy. The backrest also has a length and it will fit on your back so it's easy to sit for a long time.",
            "Design and comfort are very good. The backrest also comes to the neck so it is hard to get tired. However, because the floor of the house is a flooring, the rotation of the part that arrives at the floor of the foot is hard and it is just slipping, so it is minus one. I am still using it for a while but it is still intact. ."

            "I was able to adjust the height for the dining table, I was looking for cheap ones with casters and found it. It looks simple, but firmly in proportion to the price. The only regret is that the casters do not go around well. I sit down and it is weighty, but it does not turn around when putting in only chairs and scratches on the flooring are likely to remain. My house does not really care because I have already had a bruise, but it may be better to take care of beautiful flooring.",
            "Rollers attached to the legs do not rotate almost. I give up if I can not afford it on a price basis.",
            "It is solid for price and easy to use. However, I noticed it at the time of opening, but it was a defective item with scratches on the backrest net scratched by something. I bought it at Misato shop, but I will make this evaluation because I can not go to exchange from home away from home.",
            "It is easy to use although it has been purchased! Sitting comfort was good for the price.",
            "I use it in my workplace. Although it is using desk work almost all day, there is no problem. It is light and there is no sense of pressure. There is no reclining function, but this price is satisfied enough enough.",
            "I also put it in a small room and use it conveniently. I am glad that we can choose the gray familiar to the room. At the time of assembly, I had a hard time with the caster's driving and the backrest cover fastener, but even a single woman was fine. I do not care because it does not move, but casters do not turn around and it does not work. This price is satisfactory enough.",
            "At first I was looking at other children's chairs, but I felt narrow and small, and I felt that it became small immediately with growth, so I was looking for a chair to sit easily for adults. It was cheaper than other chairs and sitting softly on the back and the seating surface was okay. The child will soil immediately. Because it is black, here also pencil dirt is not noticeable. Because my weight is light, it seems difficult for my son to adjust the height by myself, but if my parents do it, I have no problem. It was easy to assemble and it seems to be used for a long time. I also saw other shops, but the design is simple, and I liked it at a low price.",
            "The comfort of the chair is good, but the movement of the caster is bad and there is no meaning of the caster.",
            "Easy to assemble, well designed, very likable! The backrest has become a mesh, I think that it is cool in the summer. Also, the height of the chair is just right and easy to use! However, when not sitting, the casters do not turn and will become to drag. This time I bought only one leg, I would like to make a repeat purchase.",
            "Fasteners for securing the backrest during assembly can not be closed. All the casters were hard and they did not move smoothly on the floor.",
            "It was compact and easy to use. It was troublesome to assemble.",
            "I bought it for 1 month. I am using it in the study. I am pleased that I can concentrate and tackle it firmly. It is just right to feel comfortable as you can change the height. Because it is a mesh material, it is a nice feeling without heat. It is excellent in cost performance."

However, while sitting, my feet do not reach the floor, I will move with my throbbing with a little load. And my finger's fingers that I was lying next time will get caught .... The principal seemed troublesome to grab his desk and return to the original position many times, and it was changed to a chair used at the table. It may be fine if it is used in tatami and carpet.",
            "I have used it for about 5 years. Easy to use is normal. I'm using cushions plus cushions for this cushion is hard. Also, although I give up and use it, it's pretty stressful because the back sounds so terrible. I think that this is fine for desk work and light learning, but it seems better to buy a chair for it for the body because the person who desks at all for more than 6 hours (especially in the forward tilted postures) kekked for the body."

It is helpful to pay it to the desk completely with a good knee height. Although it was certain that there were some difficult parts due to parts at the time of a set up group, five stars with cheering Nitori.",
            "Purchased red together with PC desk. The color is also as red as the photo, not red but a calm feeling red. Sitting comfort is just right to work. The backrest is also exactly rigid. Assembly is about 25 minutes by one person. The price is also reasonable, so I think whether it is enough as a performance. Since the backrest will not collapse, I think that I can not recommend it to those who want to defeat the backrest.",
            "The color is very calm. It does not feel dark at all, it feels elegant. Although the comfort of the cushion is also quite nice, the fabric feels a bit gritty, I'm sitting on a cover. A little disappointing, the part of the center cylinder protrudes from the lower base. No matter how much I looked for, there were no parts to squeeze, so I think that it probably is not wrong to assemble. (I am using it without problems) But it is still a bit uneasy, unlike the explanatory diagram. So I made four stars."

Although it is suitable for price, it is not too hard, not too soft and comfortable to sit is good. When assembling, I felt that it was difficult to understand figure-centered instructions. It was not content that anyone can understand, and I felt that it was better to have an explanation with easy-to-understand sentences.",

Even if I sit down, I get far away from the desk and it will not be usable. It is not cheap shopping and it costs money to dispose of it, so I bought a caster dish and put it on it, but it is inconvenient because I can not even move a bit. It was a shock.",
            "Scoring by the penalty point method Two points on the elbow rest part, two parts on the feet, although not noticeable, scratches were confirmed and it was -1. I do not know the market price because there is no purchase experience of furniture etc, but if you say the impression in one word \"It is 10,000 yen in this\". Although it is a personal impression to the last, it is not bad, but flat is not normal, but it is not particularly bad. Because I have lack of experience, I did not reflect the reflection on the score. We recommend black color. I felt that the black parts on the elbow rest part are mismatches. At the end it seems that studying is going to make progress with this, thank you.",
            "The item arrived on the requested date and time. Since there was an electric screwdriver (hexagonal wrench color bit), assembly completed in ten minutes. There is a strong sense of appearance, you can sit relaxedly. I think cost performance is very high.",
            "Do you buy office chairs in Nitori? It is durable. As you can see from Amazon's evaluation, the warranty of 3 months is durable enough to break in about half a year to about a year. To be one year warranty is that there is high quality. Most of the chairs are produced in China and exported to the USA. So, with a height of about 170 cm, most are too big to use. For example, from the seating surface 73 cm, most people can not sit deeply. Also, if the seat height is over 50 cm, your feet will not get stuck. I can not sit comfortably without 180 cm. From the above, I think that you can see how this chair is suitable for Japanese people. -1 points fit too much and you can concentrate on work, but relaxing with this chair is a bit difficult. Well there are as many as 100,000 chairs. It is a bit luxurious but it is -1 in future expectations. It's wonderful!",
            "The real thing is a slightly brighter white ivory. Evaluation on luxurious feeling and make-up which I do not think to cut 10,000 yen 5. It is a present for children who decided to take college entrance examinations. I changed my chair instead of changing my desk. Recommended for high school students, college students who are comfortable to sit for a long time to keep their posture fixed. If you get tired, you can get tired if you keep your head and neck in highback. In the summer season the seat surface may need a simple ingenuity, but because it is comfortable for dirt removal etc., I chose this one from the fabric. Although I am in the third year of high school, the feeling rises and the figure towards the desk has become brighter.",
            "It was surprisingly easy to assemble. Sitting comfort is also good, and there is a sense of profit at this price. This is convenient as there was no armrest in the past chairs. I'll use it carefully."
