2	us	4	HappyOne987	5 months ago	Erik Drawer used for crafting	It took me a while to put the first one together, the second one, minimal time. Not as solid as I thought for the price point, still decent quality but lower on the price scale. Wheels roll nicely. however I am storing in my closet so they aren't moved around and opened very much as they are storage for me.	Yes	4	4	5	4	5	0	0.0

5	ca	2	Halifaxbecky	11 months ago	Arrived Dented	This piece looks more solid on the website than it is on real life. It definitely is not fire resistant as there are lots of areas that are not a tight fit/seal. One of the front drawer pieces arrived dented as well.	No	2	2	4	4	3	0	1.0
