1	us	4	Allison7438	10 months ago	Odd Spacing	This is a kind of odd height — with only 2 shelves, it has a lot of space in between them. However, I bought an extra shelf and though it was tight, I was able to get 4 workable sizes out of it. The top one is about a quarter of an inch from the top of very short paperbacks, but it did work.	Yes	5	4	4	None	None	4	0
2	us	5	Pantry	2 years ago	Billy Bookcase	Used in my new reorganized pantry. Wonderful, fits perfectly and so easy to put together. Quick and easy reorg.	Yes	5	5	5	5	5	4	0
3	us	5	Jripple88	5 months ago	Sturdy	I’m very impressed with this bookshelf I almost bought a cheaper on for $15 but I’m so glad I went with this one!	Yes	5	5	5	5	5	3	0
4	us	4	Pia Carina	5 months ago	Nice bookcase	I like the fact that I can add one after the other so it looks like a long nice furniture. I only wish you would make it more sturdy, being for books. Already twice I had to return one of these because the sides bend, the hooks are tiny, and the shelves fall down with the weight of the books. I must be careful not to fill it up with books, but mix up with lighter decorations.	Yes	4	3	5	5	4	3	0
5	us	1	Wanderlust	9 months ago	Very rough boards used for this unit	It's too bad because I generally like the bookcase. It was easy to put together. However, the boards have a very rough texture. If you use a dustcloth on them, they will snag to the board. I would take them back but the waits at IKEA are horrible and the availability of merchandise unpredictable.	No	2	1	1	2	1	3	0
6	us	5	Peaches1201	2 years ago	Billy Bookcase	We wanted a sturdy sleek looking book case. This one delivered!!. But we wish they had not put in the notch (in the back) for the baseboards. We have extra tall baseboards and the notch rubs right in the middle of our baseboards. it would be nice if they sold a drawer or extra shelf to put on the bottom (to raise the bookshelf).

7	us	5	CBRTREE	5 months ago	Sturdy	Purchased for extra storage in my teen daughter's room. It's heavier and sturdier than I would have thought for the price. Easy to put together and shelves are deep enough to store wider books, text books, etc.	Yes	5	5	5	4	5	2	0
8	us	4	tammy3	a year ago	Worth it	Probably 10 years ago I bought the Billy 3 shelf bookcase in white because of the price but with white apts walls I grew tired of it. So I sold it last year and in December I bought the Billy bookcase in brown/black. The box fit in the trunk of my car (yay) and assembly was still easy enough that I could put it together myself (yay).	Yes	4	4	4	4	4	2	0
9	us	5	Jillquilt	a year ago	Perfect for my studio space	Have several Billy bookcases in my studio (I am a quilter) and find they are very versatile for my needs. Adding the baskets, magazine holders, and moving the shelves makes it customizable for almost any purpose.	Yes	5	5	5	5	5	2	0
10	us	3	wagszilla	3 months ago	Solid bookcase, beware instructions	This is a solid bookcase. It looks nice, it's easy enough to assemble, and it's decently priced. My only complaint is the materials, specifically the back panel, which is a flimsy poster board material. It's supposed to just slide in along the track but it really doesn't. When you're doing Step 7, it suggest you lay it upside down. Also the baseboard has a chip in it already. Another note about the instructions, Step 3/4 are misleading. Note the screw holes and the smooth edge of the frame. Those are your clues on how to assemble it properly. Why am I pointing this out? Step 3/4 would give you the impression that the big vertical board nearest you has the black side facing you as it's colored in black in the diagram which is not correct at all. A similar comment goes for the tall skinny board near you. While white in the diagram, the black face should be facing you here. This is the foot of the bottom of the bookcase.	Yes	4	3	4	3	4	1	0
11	us	4	AriNYC	3 months ago	Good, but dislike the safety L brackets	There's a lot to like, and two critiques. The safety L brackets are ugly and visible. They need covers, like the kind that come with the kitchen cabinets. Also, the back wall bows easily.	Yes	4	4	4	5	5	1	0
12	us	5	Shop4All	5 months ago	Just what we needed	We bought two BILLY Bookcases for our son. He placed the bookcases on either side of his fireplace, and they look great! Very affordable and functional.	Yes	5	4	5	4	5	1	0
13	us	5	ReneetheGrey	5 months ago	Perfect for all of our DVDs & games.	We bought 4 of these for the man cave, and love them. They look like built ins and are very sturdy. We love the cut out on the back for the baseboard. A great option. My husband got extra shelves to utilize the space for ALL of our movies and games.	Yes	5	5	5	5	5	1	0

15	us	5	AnissaW	6 months ago	Nice and sturdy	This is a great basic bookcase. It's very sturdy, easy to put together, and it was nice to be able to buy extra shelves for it so that it fits exactly what we want.	Yes	4	5	4	5	5	1	0
16	us	3	cmbooks 	7 months ago	An inexpensive bookcase	We needed a couple of bookshelves to replace our old one. The Billy was inexpensive. Took several tries to assemble because the measurements for the holes were off. Kept collapsing. Had to add nails for addition support. Would recommend because of the low price but would warn about the shoddy construction.	Yes	3	2	3	2	2	1	0

18	us	5	SargentP	10 months ago	Very easy and really great!	Putting it together was very simple, took me an hour to put together. I ordered it online on Feb 22 2018 and it came on the 28th, so the shipping was pretty fast. It did not come damage, nothing was missing. It was a little taller then what I expected but now having it for a couple hours I like the height of it. The quality is really good so it might last for a few years. The price was really nice and I really recommend buying this bookcase!	Yes	5	5	5	5	5	1	0
19	us	5	Memes113	11 months ago	Smaller space	We bought one for our library to go under the light switches ! Works great . One the rest of the house is finished we need a few more	Yes	5	5	5	5	5	1	0
