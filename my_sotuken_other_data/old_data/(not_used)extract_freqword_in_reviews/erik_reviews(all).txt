us	4	HappyOne987	5 months ago	Erik Drawer used for crafting	It took me a while to put the first one together, the second one, minimal time. Not as solid as I thought for the price point, still decent quality but lower on the price scale. Wheels roll nicely. however I am storing in my closet so they aren't moved around and opened very much as they are storage for me.	Yes	4	4	5	4	5	0	0
