us	1	Irishrifle	11 days ago	Saving money with cheap parts	I have owned many Billy bookcases over the years. All things being IKEA, the quality has never been superb (particle board, cheap hardware, terrible instructions, etc.) I have always expected this and most of the time with furniture, you get what you pay for. Recently I bought 2 of these bookcases. I was surprised that when putting them together, that the connector pieces that tighten down onto the funny screws broke very easily. They used to be metal, but now they are a VERY cheap plastic. I put next to no torque on several of these and they snapped. After the first two, I took extra care and still broke several. I am extremely dissatisfied with this. The prices for these products have increased over the years with little to no change. But now IKEA is being even more cheap with a pretty critical part. It goes without saying that if these pieces break, especially if you didn't realize, the furniture would be very unsafe. Especially if this furniture is anywhere near small children. Needless to say they are going back to the store.	No	1	1	3	3	1	0	0

These are very sturdy,medium height,I got them in black and they look fantastic with all the books against bright walls,very stylish and modern, and I am very happy it looks like a part of the kitchen with all the dark cabinets. Assembly was fine,like always, manual very self explanatory,easy to follow. They were not cheap but totally worth the price,because I needed something very sturdy for a lot of books, and it definitely met all my expectations! Thank you!	Yes	5	5	5	5	5	0	0
us	1	LindsTu	a month ago	Disaster! Returning	Almost everything we own is IKEA. Have been a fan since first discovered in 2002. That said, I purchased this to use as a book shelf for my son’s room. Opened the box and noticed the edges had frayed and splinterd. It is a flimsy particle board and when we tried to assemble it, a large piece of the edge just fell off as we were connecting the side and top together. The little wood dowel just cracked and split the particle board with light pressure! Never have I seen that happen before and it bemoans a cheapening of material and construction. It is unusable so now we need to drive 40miles back to return it and purchase something more solid and substantial. Very, very sad as this is becoming a trend with IKEA.	No	1	1	1	1	1	0	0

us	3	wagszilla	3 months ago	Solid bookcase, beware instructions	This is a solid bookcase. It looks nice, it's easy enough to assemble, and it's decently priced. My only complaint is the materials, specifically the back panel, which is a flimsy poster board material. It's supposed to just slide in along the track but it really doesn't. When you're doing Step 7, it suggest you lay it upside down. Also the baseboard has a chip in it already. Another note about the instructions, Step 3/4 are misleading. Note the screw holes and the smooth edge of the frame. Those are your clues on how to assemble it properly. Why am I pointing this out? Step 3/4 would give you the impression that the big vertical board nearest you has the black side facing you as it's colored in black in the diagram which is not correct at all. A similar comment goes for the tall skinny board near you. While white in the diagram, the black face should be facing you here. This is the foot of the bottom of the bookcase.	Yes	4	3	4	3	4	1	0

Along with the doors we added (separate review), it does the job admirably, The missing star comes from the fact that it would have been perfect with the Billy height extender -- but it was NOT clear that the height extender works ONLY with the tall Billy, not the short Billy. Still, we're satisfied with the purchase.

us	3	osvaldoo	2 years ago	Bookcase	It looks like advertising. The bookcase arrived wet and open by the rain. Despite the fault was the transportation, the customer support told me that I had to pay the delivery again. Fortunately there was a person that understood the issue and delivery the item without charge. But it took me a couple of hour at the phone.
