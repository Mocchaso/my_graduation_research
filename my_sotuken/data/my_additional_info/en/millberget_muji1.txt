Sitting comfort was very good! It's simple and good! I can easily adjust the height, I bought it at the desk and set but the room of the kids is natural and smell of fashionable wood is good!
When I first bought it was satisfactory to use it. However, when I leaned on the backrest as usual when I passed half a year, I heard a sound. And recently, when sitting without putting your feet on the floor, it came to turn freely.
For elementary school children, I bought it with my desk. Natural atmosphere is very good, and the person himself likes it. I think that it is still better if the caster has a stopper.
Compact and simple design is familiar to the interior. It is unavoidable to remove the cover and wash it. Even if it is used for several years, the cushion does not get tangled. The seat surface is small. There is no problem to sit a bit, but when I sit for a long time I get tired. The cover slips.
I bought it for a child. It seems I was delightful to taste the feeling of adult because it is the season I want to stretch still more (lol)
