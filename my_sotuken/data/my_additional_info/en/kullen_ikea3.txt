I saw the catalog and liked it! Clothes storage is excellent.
I like the design is simple and easy to use, also functional. However, due to the fact that the assembly of the drawer was an inlay type, it has just gone away while using it, and has caused trouble to reposition each time.
There is space under the washroom and I found this chest if I searched for a chest that matched that size. I like the color and size perfectly.
I purchased it and assembled it, but I want you to make it easy to understand the manual of how to assemble.
