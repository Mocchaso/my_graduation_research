It was hard to purchase and complete assembly. There are lack of expression in the instructions, places to buy desk screws brought together, there are design problems?
I bought it in my daughter's room. I was worried whether it could be assembled, but since the explanation was easy to understand, it was possible for two women to be completed. It is like purchasing the glass to put on the chest and becoming more cute and becoming the daughter's favorite space!
I put it in the 12 tatami living room, but it is just good size The top surface is used as the model decoration table It was able to store clothing for two people separated by the center Assembly was as line as the instruction For example, it will be completed in about 90 minutes. A part of the pilot hole is covered with a knot and there are places where wood screws can not enter. The wood screw is a plus screw, but a woman with weak grip (wife) is struggling with a driver I will see what you are doing, is it easier for screws with hexagon socket holes? The painting has a slight grain of grain rising, there is a warm atmosphere There is a warm ambience Future furniture with legs is somewhat smart and the room looks broad
I bought it for the change of three children's changing clothes. I use IKEA's partition box, SKUBB, in the drawer. It is quite easy to use by using this partition. The chest is also simple and fashionable. I'm glad I bought it. Please prepare for assembly if you are alone! It takes time.
It is very convenient to open a restaurant and to store the stand for the cash register and the necessary items. Because it can be seen from customers, it matches as interior and uses it as the layout of the shop.
