It was the same as a general color box, so it was easy to assemble without confusion. Unlike plywood with slippery, natural atmosphere. If only this is the case for the children's room is too simple, but the balance is nice, as the toys and picture books are colorful. There is not much case for Mr. Mr. to fit the pulp board box, so if you try using stack stack basket, Cinderella Fit! The price is a little expensive, is not it?
I used it as a shelf to clean up children's toys, and this time it will be a purchase addition. It is favorite with moderate strength.
I layered three pulp board boxes side by side, layered on top of it, and put three slim slices one side upside down. I also attached joint fittings. As a shelf to clean up magazines and children's toys, I used it for about a week in the living room, feel good as I watched it, and so far the strength seems to have no problem .... Tighten the screws and lay it sideways, just the screws and screws strike, so subtly it? I got a gap. I guess I had to tighten it enough to snap into the board with an electric drill etc .... Although the instructions says that it is not over tightened .... I think that it was good if a plate had a dent so that the board would be flat even if you tightened the screw. That's why we need measures such as laying something on the floor. It is stacked horizontally! In other words, I thought that there was no consideration.
