I use it by putting it on the bedside of a legged mattress. In our home, when visiting, there are things to use when there are not enough chairs, this product that will do two functions is very useful.
Put TV, sit down, very convenient! I feel that colors will fit in any room. It would be nice if the same series is like another low table!
Purchased for putting on the bedside. Just being there, it became a picture bedroom.
In my home with many guests, I gather up the chairs in my house every time, but recently I found this with MUJI and bought it. As a side table in the dining room usually, it quickly changes to a chair when visiting. In one case, he also acts as a stepping stone with a low height. I also like the atmosphere, so I wish I could buy it sooner.
