I am concerned about the smell, but there is no cheapness with firm making. It seems to be useful for organizing documents.
We bought 3 rows Ã— 2 rows of stacking shelves in the children's room of our two sons. After worrying for several days, I bought these 4 chests and 2 chests additionally. The chest that arrived at our house, although there was no color difference with the shelf like the review, there is a quite tight smell like other reviews .... Somewhat cleanliness & smell sensitive sons arranged their mouths, saying "It might be a bit impossible", so we decided to put it in the living room .... Well, it can not be helped because it was a purchase after reviewing the review. However! ! On the day after the item was delivered by purchasing at the net store, an e-mail "We reviewed the price" arrived, and the same product series was cheaper by 2,000 yen. I feel really damaged. Another shop says that I can use it well, but it can not be helped, but another shop says, "If you try to purchase items that you plan to earn from 1 week to 10 days later, in a hurry Because I will send you an e-mail cheaply from x days later ... (Though it is truly kind-hearted SHOP when I think about it again), this time, in particular, in addition to the smell a little discomfort increased.
