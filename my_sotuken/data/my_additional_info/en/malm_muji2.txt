I own all other chests, but this drawer four-tier chest is the best! It is too good to own four additional. It is a family of 4 people, chest using one person per person, chest separating for each document, sorting as an accessory case. I also do a small partition with a mu - no PP case! It is good for those looking for a shallow shelf!
There are several types of stacking chests, but it is the easiest to use form that I like best. Recently price has also declined. Half size comes out and ease of use is getting even more.
