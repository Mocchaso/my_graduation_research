I feel comfortable to sit and it will not be painful for a long time.
I bought it for the table, but it is easy to assemble and easy to sit with the cushion being firm and very handy.
I bought it for my husband's work! Initially I was looking for something that does not rotate, but I decided to make a prompt decision with a comfortable feeling. I hope I can use it without failing. It was still good if the color of the cover was not white.
The chair purchased at elementary school entrance came out of conformity with body, so I was looking for something good. Staff at the sales department looked for a chair to go with my daughter. The price was reasonable, the assembly procedure was small and the instructions were easy to understand. I think that it is good for the girl who aims for a girlly room in country with country French.
