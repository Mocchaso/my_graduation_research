Compared to the price, it is a solid board, you can store plenty of textbooks and hardcover books. Assembly was also stronger than 30 minutes by two people. The only disappointing thing is that I bought what I do not want the colors I want. It is really disappointing there just because two tone color with a natural board was hope. When I bought a baby chair the last time I have made a mistake in color, and I want to make this mistake last. (Will it be only at our house?) If you want a greedy number next to the item number, it is easier to pick up in the warehouse.
IKEA product thought that she could add a shelf later but this product only has no shelf sold separately. I am a little dissatisfied. ...
I got lost as Billy, but I like design, color is cute and there is depth, bought here though it was over budget. If I only want one point, I think that it was better if additional shelves were sold separately.
I am familiar with the room as imagined and also fulfill the function. I'm satisfied.
Pictures and descriptions of assembly instructions are too easy to understand.
